Be it search engine, recommendation system, streaming service, interactive agent, or collaborative system, multimedia plays a critical role in ensuring full understanding of multimodal sensory signals, robust modeling of user-content interaction, natural and rich communication experience, and scalable system deployment. The goal is to utilize unique contributions from each modality, integrate complementary synergies, and achieve the best performance and novel functions beyond what's separately available in each individual medium. In this community, most contributors also maintain strong activities in other disciplines such as networking, computer vision, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. But the field of multimedia is unique in offering a rich and dynamic forum for researchers from "traditional" fields to collaborate and develop new solutions and knowledge that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines.The field enjoys a long history of vibrant research. For example, the flagship ACM SIGMM Multimedia Conference was established in 1993, celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. The community also has several well-known conferences and journals organized by ACM, IEEE, and other groups, attracting a large number of researchers and practitioners from around the world. However, despite the prolific research activities and outcomes, there has been less effort toward developing books that serve as an introduction to the rich spectrum of topics in this broad field. Most of the few books available today either focus on specific subfields or basic background. There is a lack of tutorial-style materials covering the active topics being pursued by the leading researchers at frontiers of the field.SIGMM launched a new initiative to address this need in 2015, by selecting and inviting 12 rising-star speakers from different subfields of multimedia to deliver plenary tutorial style talks at ACM Multimedia 2015. Each speaker discussed challenges and the state of the art within their prospective research areas in a general manner to the broad community. Topics covered were comprehensive, including multimedia content understanding, multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction, multimedia social media, and multimedia system architecture and deployment. Following the very positive responses to the talks, these rising-star speakers were invited to expand the content covered in their talks to chapters that can be used as reference materials for researchers, students, and practitioners. Each resulting chapter discusses problems, technical challenges, state-of-the-art approaches and performances, open issues, and promising directions for future work. Collectively, the chapters provide an excellent sampling of major topics addressed by the community as a whole. This book, capturing outcomes of such efforts, is well positioned to fill the aforementioned needs by providing tutorial-style reference materials for frontier topics of multimedia.Section 1 of the book includes five chapters that are focused on analysis and understanding of multimedia content. Topics covered range from analysis of video content, audio content, multimodal content about interaction of freestanding conversational groups, and analysis of multimedia data in the encrypted format for preserving privacy on cloud servers, to efficient approximate similarity search techniques for searching over large-scale databases.First, Zuxuan Wu et al. review current research on understanding video content by detecting the classes of actions or events contained in a given video clip and generation of full-sentence captions describing the content in each such video. Unlike previous surveys, this review focuses on solutions based on deep learning, reflecting the recent trend of research in this area. The chapter also gives extensive reviews of the datasets used in state-of-the-art research and benchmarking efforts.Extending the modality from video to audio, in Chapter 2, Gerald Friedland et al. introduce the field of computer audition, aiming to develop the theory behind artificial systems that can extract information from sound. This chapter reviews the research datasets available, appropriate representations needed for audio, and a few challenging problems such as automatic extraction of hierarchical semantic structures from audio content and automatic discovery of high-level semantic concepts from massive audio data and associated metadata.The holy grail of research for the multimedia community is to be able to integrate and fuse information extracted from multiple modalities of data. In Chapter 3, Xavier Alameda-Pineda et al. present an excellent example and emergent research challenges in the application of detecting social interaction among freestanding conversational groups. The chapter includes overviews of research issues, approaches, evaluation of joint estimation of head and body poses using multiPreface modality data (such as wearable sensors and distributed camera networks), and results of detecting dynamic group formation of interacting people.Chapter 4 addresses a novel emerging topic prompted by the popular approach to multimedia analysis using cloud computing servers. When multimedia data is sent to the cloud for storage or processing, there is a risk of privacy breach via unauthorized access by third parties to the content in the cloud. Pradeep Atrey et al. review state-of-the-art methods and open issues for processing multimedia content in the encrypted domain without needing to convert data to the original format. This allows content to stay in its protected form while useful analysis is performed on it.In Chapter 5, Herv{\'{e}}e Jeundefinedou surveys efficient techniques for finding approximate solutions for similarity search, which is of particular interest when searching massive multimedia data like images, videos, and audio recordings. Jeundefinedou considers various performance factors like query speed, memory requirement, and search accuracy. Multiple frameworks based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH), quantization/ compression, and hybrid combinations are also reviewed in a coherent manner.In Section 2 of the book, the emphasis shifts from content analysis to humancentered aspects of multimedia computing. This new focus goes beyond extraction of semantic information from multimedia data. Instead, the broad research scope incorporates understanding of users and user-content interaction so as to improve effectiveness of multimedia systems in many applications, such as search and recommendation.Under the human-centric theme, Chapter 6, authored by Peng Cui, discusses the evolution of multimedia computing paradigms from the data-centric, to the content-centric, and recently to the human-centric. Cui presents a new framework, called social-sensed multimedia computing, to capture many key issues involved and advances achieved, including understanding of user-content interaction behavior, understanding of user intent, multimedia representation considering user intention, and integration of heterogeneous data sensed on multimedia social networks.Chapter 7 follows the human-centric theme and further moves the focus from processing individual multimedia data streams to processing a large number of heterogeneous streams in different modalities involving a large number of people. Analysis of such massive streams offers the possibility of detecting important situations of society, such as socio-economic affairs, as well as the living environment. Vivek Singh provides an overview of the problem definition, research framework, and the EventShop toolkit he developed for application development in this emerging area.The extension to the human-centric computing paradigm also calls for formal mathematical theories and tools for explaining the phenomena observed, such as the information propagation behaviors and the occurrences of information cascades on social networks. In Chapter 8, Marian-Andrei Rizoiu et al. review stochastic processes such as the Hawkes point process for modeling discrete, interdependent events over continuous time. These are strongly related to patterns corresponding to retweet cascade events on social media. Successful models like these can help researchers understand information dissemination patterns and predict popularity on social media.Interaction between users and content reveals not only the intent of the user (covered in Chapter 6), but also attributes of the content as well as of the user him/herself. Such interaction can be manifested in multiple forms including explicit cues such as visual and verbal expressions, and implicit cues such as eye movement and physiological signals like brain activity and heart rate. Chapter 9 includes a survey by Subramanian Ramanathan et al. on how such implicit user interaction cues can be explored to improve analysis of content (scene understanding) and user (user emotion recognition).To support research and development of emerging multimedia topics discussed above, there is a critical need for new generations of communication and computing systems that take into account the unique requirements of multimedia, such as real-time, high bandwidth, distributiveness, major power consumption, and resource uncertainty. The popular cloud-based computing systems, though prevalent formanyapplications, are not suitable for large-scale multimedia applications such as cloud-based gaming service and animation rendering service.The last section of the book focuses on the systems aspect, covering distinct topics of multimedia fog computing (Chapter 10) and cloud gaming (Chapter 11). Cheng-Hsin Hsu et al. survey the emerging paradigm focused on fog computing, in which computing services are crowdsourced to the edge nodes or even to the client devices on the user end. This offers major potential benefits in terms of low latency, location awareness, scalability, and heterogeneity. However, it also poses many significant challenges in areas such as resource discovery, resource allocation and management, quality of service, and security. Discussion of these challenges, along with recent advances in this area, are presented in Chapter 10.Finally, as a concrete example of large-scale distributed multimedia computing systems, Chapter 11 (by Kuan-Ta Chen et al.) presents a comprehensive survey of cloud gaming, with emphasis on the development of platform and testbed, test scenarios, and evaluation of performance, in order to enhance optimal design of various components of the complex cloud gaming systems. In particular, the chapter overviews extensive research in areas such as open-source platforms, cloud deployment, client design, and communication between gaming servers and clients.The scope of this book is by no means exhaustive or complete. For example, it can be expanded to include other important topics such as (but not limited to) multimedia content generation, multimodal knowledge discovery and representation, multimedia immersive networked environments, and applications in areas like healthcare, learning, and infrastructure. Nonetheless, the comprehensive survey materials already covered in the book provide an excellent foundation for exploring additional topics mentioned above, and many other relevant fields.We would like to give sincere acknowledgment to Dr. Svebor Karaman, who has provided tremendous assistance in communicating with contributors and organizing the content of this book. In addition, Diane Cerra and her team at Morgan {\&} Claypool Publishers have provided valuable guidance and editorial help","","","",""

The purpose of the paper is to present, on the basis of own research, the main e-commerce threats from the perspective of the customer and the seller, and to indicate the possibility of their elimination, which should contribute to sustainable development. The threats from the e-customer's perspective were identified by considering individual phases of online purchase. In the case of e-shops, the threats were analyzed in a personnel—computer hardware—software structure. As conducted research shows, the threats for e-customers are located in three main areas: security of the means of payment, security of personal data and payment cards, and security of purchased goods. The security of the e-customer largely depends on the security of the e-store in which the purchase is made. Research has shown that e-stores are not fully secure, which mainly results from negligence and the lack of knowledge in the sphere of cybersecurity.","","Computer security,Consumerism,Consumption,Customers,Electronic commerce,Environmental Studies,Environmental impact,Exploitation,Literature reviews,Negligence,Population growth,Security,Shopping,Social problems,Sustainable development,Threat evaluation,Threats,e-commerce,e-customer,e-shop,security,social threats,sustainable development","",""

The social nature of such applications encourages users to share a great amount of personal data with other users and the OSN service providers, including pictures, personal views, location check-ins, etc. Nevertheless, recent data leaks on major online platforms demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the access control mechanisms that are implemented by the service providers, and has led to an increased demand for provably secure privacy controls. To this end, we introduce Hide In The Crowd (HITC), a flexible system that leverages encryption-based access control, where users can assign arbitrary decryption privileges to every data object that is posted on the OSN platforms. The decryption privileges can be assigned on the finest granularity level, for example, to a hand-picked group of users. HITC is designed as a browser extension and can be integrated to any existing OSN platform without the need for a third-party server. We describe our prototype implementation of HITC over Twitter and evaluate its performance and scalability.","","data privacy, hidden vector encryption, online social networks,access control","",""

The protection mechanisms should meet the requirements for the correct management of fine-grained access and usage controls and the protection of user privacy. Digital rights management (DRM) solutions have significant relevance in this context. This paper describes a distributed DRM model for a secure information-distribution system consisting of six trust-building blocks. These are (i) the user application, (ii) the authentication and authorization module, (iii) Rights-Carrying and Self-Enforcing Objects (SEOs), (iv) the privacy enforcement module, (v) the Usage Tracking and Monitoring Proxy (UTMP), and (vi) the security infrastructure. SEOs are information objects that carry access and usage rights and are responsible for the fine-grained enforcement of these rights. The security infrastructure plays a pivotal role in the creation, distribution, storage, manipulation, and communication of information objects across organizational boundaries with the required level of security. Our model was originally developed for an Internet-based learning project in Norwegian schools and meets most of the aforementioned requirements.

Individuals lose track of their personal data and have no control over databases and information systems containing their personal data. In the field of distributed systems, resarchers focus mainly on how to integrate a variety of systems in a way so that persons benefit from other systems' functionalities and data sources. In general, the integration is done on the business logic layer. As a consequence special properties of data, like privacy properties, are neglected. In fact, it is a big challenge for distributed applications to adapt privacy regulations, to ensure conformity to privacy regulations, and to execute the adaptation process in a transparent and comprehensible form. Unlike most existing work, this paper provides a solution to the problem of adapting privacy regulations in a distributed environment. The framework presented in this study is a novel enterprise architecture that assures privacy according to diverse data privacy regulations and illustrates the adapting process in a transparent and comprehensible form. Moreover, it maintains and enhances additional data privacy properties wherever they apply.","","access control, information flow control, privacy,policy enforcement","",""

We highlight how the economic analysis of privacy evolved over time, as advancements in information technology raised increasingly nuanced and complex issues. We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance and detract from individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences. We conclude the article by highlighting some of the ongoing issues in the privacy debate of interest to economists.

The Internet of Things (IoT), with its promise to create networks of networks, will magnify individual data privacy threats. Recent data breaches, exposing the personal information of millions of users, provide insight into the vulnerability of personal data. Although seemingly expansive, there are core individual privacy issues that are central to current big data breaches and anticipated IoT threats. This article examines both big data and the IoT using examples of data privacy breaches to illustrate the impact of individual data loss. Furthermore, the article examines the complexity of tackling technological and legislative challenges in protecting individual privacy.

The aim of the research was to develop a reliable measurement scale for quantifying and comparing attitudes towards personal data that can be incorporated into cybersecurity behavioural research models. Such a scale has become necessary for understanding individuals' attitudes towards specific sets of data, as more technologies are being designed to harvest, collate, share and analyse personal data.Design/methodology/approachAn initial set of 34 five-point Likert-style items were developed with eight subscales and administered to participants online. The data collected were subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and MANOVA. The results are consistent with the multidimensionality of attitude theories and suggest that the adopted methodology for the study is appropriate for future research with a more representative sample.FindingsFactor analysis of 247 responses identified six constructs of individuals' attitude towards personal data: protective behaviour, privacy concerns, cost-benefit, awareness, responsibility and security. This paper illustrates how the PDA scale can be a useful guide for information security research and design by briefly discussing the factor structure of the PDA and related results.Originality/valueThis study addresses a genuine gap in research by taking the first step towards establishing empirical evidence for dimensions underlying personal data attitudes.

In the end, we will stress that, freelance web developers have higher form of responsibility and should actively seek to bring about environments in which they can function as responsible agents aiming at developing safe, secure, and workable web applications and systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","","2410:Social responsibility,5240:Software {\&} systems,9130:Experimental/theoretical,Computers--Information Science And Information The,Employment,Ethics,Freelance,Professionals,Responsibilities,Software,Studies","",""

However, the data privacy challenges and tensions that arise when people share devices have not been studied in depth. This paper presents a qualitative study with 72 participants that analyzes how families in Bangladesh currently share mobile phones, their usage patterns, and the tensions and challenges that arise as individuals seek to protect the privacy of their personal data. We show how people share devices out of economic need, but also because sharing is a social and cultural practice that is deeply embedded in Bangladeshi society. We also discuss how prevalent power relationships affect sharing practices and reveal gender dynamics that impact the privacy of women's data. Finally, we highlight strategies that participants adopted to protect their private data from the people with whom they share devices. Taken together, our findings have broad implications that advance the CSCW community's understanding of digital privacy outside the Western world.","","access,hci4d,ictd,mobile devices,privacy,shared use","",""

The data set of Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) 2014/2015 and 42 semi-structured interviews conducted with victims of cybercrime and non-victim control group participants were analysed via binary logistic regression and content analyses methods.FindingsThis research illustrated that Internet users facilitated their victimisation through their online activities. Additionally, using insecure Internet connections and public access computers emerged as risk factors for both cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent crime victimisation. Voluntary and involuntary personal information disclosure through social networking sites and online advertisement websites increased the likelihood of being a target of phishing. Deviant online activities such as free streaming or peer-to-peer sharing emerged to increase the risk of cyber-dependent crime victimisation.Research limitations/implicationsThe binary logistic regression analysis results suggested LRAT as a more suitable theoretical framework for cyber-dependent crime victimisation. Future research may test this result with models including more macro variables.Practical implicationsPolicymakers may consider implementing regulations regarding limiting the type of information required to login to free Wi-Fi connections. Checking trust signs and green padlocks may be effective safeguarding measures to lessen the adverse impacts of impulsive buying.Originality/valueThis study empirically illustrated that, besides individual-level factors, macro-level factors such as electronic devices being utilised to access the Internet and data breaches of large companies also increased the likelihood of becoming the victim of cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent crime.","","Access control,Computers--Internet,Crime,Cyber-dependent crime,Cyber-enabled crime,Cybercrime,Digital media,Electronic devices,Guardians,Human factors,Internet,Internet access,Internet crime,Lifestyle routine activities theory,Lifestyles,Locks,Malware,Phishing,Regression analysis,Risk analysis,United Kingdom--UK,Victimisation,Victimization,Websites","",""

Exploring customers' perceptions of such big data initiatives in retail environments, we develop a model examining the effects of technology enablers and privacy concerns on critical shopping outcomes including repatronage intentions, store image, and intention to use medium in the context of recently identified service configurations. We conduct an exploratory study to understand customers' reactions toward emerging shopping scenarios and to enhance our survey instrument and then conduct an online survey (n = 442) to test our model. We found that customers' usefulness perceptions of emerging services positively affected their intentions to use medium, and that their privacy concerns about the amounts of personal information, being collected through emerging services, negatively affected their repatronage intentions and store image.

These SIM-swap attacks are often targeted at cryptocurrency (e.g., bitcoin) holders and can result in thousands or even millions of dollars in losses. Wireless providers are often the weakest point exploited by hackers in SIM-swap attacks. These hacks are even more insidious because they rely primarily on social vulnerabilities rather than technical skill: hackers pressure accommodating customer service agents or bribe wireless provider employees in order to gain control of a wireless providers account and phone number. The wireless account and phone number provide a gateway to all the wireless customer's digital accounts through password reset codes sent to the victim's phone number, which is controlled by the hacker. Yet, wireless providers have failed to protect this gateway. Experience has shown that it is surprisingly too easy for a hacker to gain control of a wireless customer's phone number. This note argues that wireless providers should be liable for negligence according to a reasonableness standard of care. Such a standard would motivate them to do more to protect wireless customers. Wireless customers are being harmed by hackers. Wireless providers are positioned to prevent that harm by blocking unauthorized control of customer phone numbers. This note provides background on the SIM-swap attack, addresses policy arguments supporting the liability of wireless providers, examines how liability of wireless providers can be found under statutory federal law, and argues that common law negligence is the most appropriate route to wireless provider liability. The policy-based arguments address victims with a pressing need for remedy, wireless providers as the least cost avoider, and wireless providers as the most competent avoider. The law-based arguments address the roles of the FCC and the FTC in SIM-swap attacks and distinguish developments in negligence common law liability for general data breaches. In short, this note argues that SIM-swap attacks give rise to important harms, wireless providers should be liable for those harms, and negligence with a reasonableness standard of care is the right standard for liability.","","Customer services,Customers,Digital currencies,Digits,Employees,Federal legislation,Hackers,Liability,Negligence,Passwords,Short message service,Social networks,Studies,Technology: Comprehensive Works,Text messaging,United States--US,Wireless networks","",""

Consumers often have only the stated Web site policies as a guide to how their information is used, and thus on which to base their browsing and transaction decisions. However, each policy is different, and it is difficult--if not impossible--for the average user to compare and comprehend these policies. This paper presents a taxonomy of privacy requirements for Web sites. Using goal-mining, the extraction of pre-requirements goals from post-requirements text artefacts, we analysed an initial set of Internet privacy policies to develop the taxonomy. This taxonomy was then validated during a second goal extraction exercise, involving privacy policies from a range of health care related Web sites. This validation effort enabled further refinement to the taxonomy, culminating in two classes of privacy requirements: protection goals and vulnerabilities. Protection goals express the desired protection of consumer privacy rights, whereas vulnerabilities describe requirements that potentially threaten consumer privacy. The identified taxonomy categories are useful for analysing implicit internal conflicts within privacy policies, the corresponding Web sites, and their manner of operation. These categories can be used by Web site designers to reduce Web site privacy vulnerabilities and ensure that their stated and actual policies are consistent with each other. The same categories can be used by customers to evaluate and understand policies and their limitations. Additionally, the policies have potential use by third-party evaluators of site policies and conflicts.","","Computers--Software","",""

Responding to this requirement raises the emerging need of solutions supporting proper information security governance, allowing enterprises managing user information to enforce restrictions on information acquisition as well as its processing and secondary use. While the research community has acknowledged this emerging scenario, and research efforts are being devoted to it, current technologies provide still limited solutions to the problem.In this paper, we illustrate our effort in pursuing the goal of bringing information security governance restrictions deployable in current organizational contexts. Considering the large success and application of XACML, we extend the XACML architecture and modules complementing them with functionalities for effective credential-based management and privacy support. Our proposal combines XACML with PRIME, a novel solution supporting privacy-aware access control, resulting in an infrastructure that provides the flexible access functionality of XACML enriched with the data governance and privacy features of PRIME.","","access control, data governance, xacml,privacy","",""

The problems that have arisen are due to the need to ensure the inviolability of computer information, the operation of the system or networks precluding harm to a person, society or the state. The development of the information space inevitably has a negative impact on the rights of every person encroaching on privacy. International instruments are aimed at implementing measures to ensure the inadmissibility of the collection, storage, use and dissemination of information about the private life of a person without his consent. Regulation of cyberspace in the context of legal informatization actualizes the acceptance of measures at the regional level to be fixed in legislative acts. Improvement of technological means of information protection is required. The development of information technology entails the active use of legal measures of influence. These measures should be aimed at protecting the state system, the country's defense, state security, morality and public health. The main objectives of the regulation of information and legal space are recognized information and legal support of the state bodies, legal entities and individuals and the preservation of the information legal field. The legislator at the regional level develops measures of counteraction. Legal measures play a key role in the regulation of information and legal space.","","Access to information,Computers,Criminal law,Information dissemination,Information technology,Internet crime,Morality,Privacy,Self interest,Travel And Tourism","",""

We posit that both habit cues and information security experiential factors influence DSR, leading to habitual use of unknown wireless networks. The results show that perceived attachment, perceptions on privacy risk, and information security self-efficacy significantly influence DSR, which subsequently influences habitual use of unknown wireless networks.

This paper reports a data-driven analysis of CRA- and GDPR-related discussions on Twitter. Our analysis covers the three largest multi-national CRAs: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion and we also looked at the UK's data protection authority, ICO, and two UK-based privacy-advocating NGOs, Privacy International and Open Rights Group (ORG). We have analyzed public tweets of their official Twitter accounts and other public tweets talking about them. Our analysis revealed a very surprising lack of awareness of CRA- and GDPR-related data privacy issues within the general public and an astonishing lack of active communications of CRAs to the general public on relevant GDPR-related privacy issues: out of 39,549 collected tweets we identified only 153 relevant tweets (0.387{\%}). This small number of tweets are dominated by mentions of security issues ({\%}73.2), especially data breaches affecting CRAs, not data subject rights or privacy issues directly. Other tweets are mainly about complaints regarding inaccurate data in credit files and questions about how to exercise right to rectification, just two of many data subject rights defined in the GDPR.","","GDPR, communication, credit reference agencies, data protection, general data protection regulation, law, online social networks, privacy, social media, twitter,transparency","",""

They have some limitations like inflexibility in unanticipated circumstances (e.g., emergency). Recently, a posteriori access control has been proposed to complete a priori protection for a more effective and flexible solution. It controls the access by deterring user from having unauthorized access. To be deployed, a posteriori access control needs evidence to prove the users' violations. In this paper, we show how log records defined by the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise-Audit Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA) profile can be used to deploy an a posteriori access control system.

This can be described as a comprehensive 'Data Protection Compliance Program' which becomes "the" requirement that makes data processing legitimate on its ground; while other more traditional legal bases of achieving legitimacy, such as data subject consent to processing, may be less relevant, because they do not necessarily offer an appropriate level of protection of personal data, nor do they support a flexible implementation of the user control paradigm.

The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enables users to control their data and be informed about any devices involved in collecting and processing this data. The overall objective is to enable individuals to have full rights and control over their data assets and to be able to transfer their data without any unmitigated risk. Blockchains provide the benefits of a distributed ledger that can securely manage digital transactions -- where the centralisation of data is eliminated. Blockchains have recently entered as an enabling technology into the IoT market, and used in a variety of different application areas. Blockchains enable the implementation of a more trusted system capable of processing operations between IoT services and sources of data. In smart buildings, for example, Blockchains support the formation of smart contracts as a means to give transactional capabilities to IoT devices, allowing users to keep data ownership and privacy using an immutable dataset.

Last updated - 2020-09-18","The risk of personal data exposure through unauthorized access has never been as imminent as today. To counter this, biometric authentication has been proposed: the use of distinctive physiological and behavioral characteristics as a form of identification and access control. One of the recent developments is electroencephalography (EEG)-based authentication. It builds on the subject-specific nature of brain responses which are difficult to recreate artificially. We propose an authentication system based on EEG signals recorded in response to a simple motor paradigm. Authentication is achieved with a novel two-stage decoder. In the first stage, EEG signal features are extracted using an inception- and a VGG-like deep learning neural network (NN) both of which we compare with principal component analysis (PCA). In the second stage, a support vector machine (SVM) is used for binary classification to authenticate the subject based on the extracted features. All decoders are trained on EEG motor-movement data recorded from 105 subjects. We achieved with the VGG-like NN-SVM decoder a false-acceptance rate (FAR) of 2.55{\%} with an overall accuracy of 88.29{\%}, a FAR of 3.33{\%} with an accuracy of 87.47{\%}, and a FAR of 2.89{\%} with an accuracy of 90.68{\%} for 8, 16, and 64 channels, respectively. With the Inception-like NN-SVM decoder we achieved a false-acceptance rate (FAR) of 4.08{\%} with an overall accuracy of 87.29{\%}, a FAR of 3.53{\%} with an accuracy of 85.31{\%}, and a FAR of 1.27{\%} with an accuracy of 93.40{\%} for 8, 16, and 64 channels, respectively. The PCA-SVM decoder achieved accuracies of 92.09{\%}, 92.36{\%}, and 95.64{\%} with FARs of 2.19{\%}, 2.17{\%}, and 1.26{\%} for 8, 16, and 64 channels, respectively.","","Access control,Accuracy,Biology--Biotechnology,Biometrics,Channels,Classification,Datasets,Decoders,EEG,Electroencephalography,Entropy,Feature extraction,Identification,Machine learning,Neural networks,Power,Principal components analysis,SVM,Support vector machines,neural network,person authentication","",""

Younger generations have grown up in a world where internet access, social networking, e-commerce and smartphones are commonplace. Given this fact, they have learned how to use, and how to abuse, technology. This leads us to define a new category of cybercrime called a Personal Denial of Service attack (PDOS). A PDOS is a cyber-crime in which an individual deliberately prevents the access of another individual or small group to online services such as email or banking. Due to the nature of a PDOS, these acts can be overlooked by law enforcement and organizations that operate Internet infrastructure, such as universities. Our motivation for this work is twofold: to stress the need for cyber ethics education at the university level, and to illustrate how a previously uncategorized type of cyber crime is easily perpetrated in such an environment. To achieve these goals, we define a PDOS attack and discuss how it differs from other categories of attacks. We also examine the motivation for a PDOS attack in the context of the Routine Activities Theory of criminal justice. We further discuss a "proof of concept" survey administered at four different universities to ascertain their attitudes towards online account breaches as related to a PDOS attack. The survey provides initial evidence that account breaches, which are an integral part of a PDOS attack, are a worrisome threat on university campuses and further points to a need for cyber ethics training.","","Bullying,Colleges {\&} universities,Crime,Criminology And Law Enforcement,Electronic banking,Internet crime,Network security","",""

It also evaluates acceptance and perceived protection of existing and novel authentication methods. The responses from 465 participants reveal that users are interested in increased security and data protection. The current protection by using PIN (Personal Identification Number) is perceived as neither adequate nor convenient in all cases. The sensitivity of data stored on the devices varies depending on the data type and the context of use, asking for the need for another level of protection. According to these findings, a two-level security model for mobile phones is proposed. The model provides differential data and service protection by utilizing existing capabilities of a mobile phone for authenticating users.","","authentication, authentication methods, data protection, graded security model, survey,mobile phone security","",""

The conventional wisdom in both countries, whether accurate or not, is that the modern political campaign needs to be ‘data driven' to consolidate existing support and to find potential new voters and donors. The capture and consolidation of these data permit the construction of detailed profiles on individual voters and the ‘micro-targeting' of increasingly precise messages to increasingly refined segments of the electorate, especially in marginal constituencies.1 Although there are huge differences between presidential systems such as the US and European parliamentary systems, there is evidence that parties in other countries are drawing lessons from the US experience and that similar techniques are gradually entering their politics.2 There is extensive cross-national communication about these techniques through the network of political and technical consultants, who are eager to tout the benefits of micro-targeting and data-driven campaigning, and to sell the range of software applications, for both database and mobile environments.","","81394:Political Organizations,Big Data,Canada,Databases,Democracy,Elections,Europe,Law,Marketing,Political parties,Privacy,State laws,Surveillance,Trends,United States--US","",""

Autonomous vehicles handle large amounts of data and can connect to more and more existing devices, smartphones, tablets, or even other cars and systems. This poses the risk of unauthorized access to data. Theoretically cars have separate computer units, operate in isolation, and are not connected, so there is less possibility to be attacked. However if the vehicles are interconnected, hackers can have easier access to personal data. They can get information about the location of the car owner, their typical trips, and, for example, allow an intruder to know when the tracked person is not at home. Furthermore it can also be happened that the vehicle operation is maliciously disturbed, which can result in a security risk for the passengers. In extreme cases, computer terrorist attacks can also be prepared - large-scale interventions on roads can lead to chaos across a region or country. In accordance with the introduced threats, it is a crucial objective of this research to indicate specific methods, which can help the industry to evaluate and prepare for these kinds of attacks in a proper way.","","Automobiles,Computer security,Tablet computers,Terrorism,Transportation,Vehicles","",""

However, they are willing to trade privacy for additional benefits if their sensed information is used for effective and beneficial causes. Furthermore, they are willing to trust reputed technology companies, with their data, if the benefits are significant. Based on these results, we propose a few design guidelines for designers of personal sensing apps and outline some interesting directions for future research.","","Detection,Privacy,Smartphones,Technology: Comprehensive Works","",""

Big data defies this linear logic, in that it decontextualizes data from its original environment and conducts an algorithmic nonlinear mix, match, and mine analysis. Applying data protection law to the processing of big data does not work well, to say the least.This Article examines the case of big medical data. A survey of emerging research practices indicates that studies either ignore data protection law altogether or assume an ex post position, namely that because they are conducted after the data has already been created in the course of providing medical care, and they use de-identified data, they go under the radar of data protection law. These studies focus on the end-point of the lifecycle of big data: if sufficiently anonymous at publication, the previous steps are overlooked, on the claim that they enjoy immunity. I argue that this answer is too crude. To portray data protection law in its best light, we should view it as a process-based attempt to equip data subjects with some power to control personal data about them, in all phases of data processing.Such control reflects the underlying justification of data protection law as an implementation of human dignity. The process-based approach fits current legal practices and is justified by reflecting dignitarian conceptions of informational privacy.","","44511:Supermarkets and Other Grocery (except Conve,Big Data,Indictments,Law,Supermarkets","",""

However, some analysts argue that these practices have the potential to invade applicants' privacy because they gather personal data that were originally intended for family and friends, or collect information that is not job related (e.g., off duty behavior, membership in protected classes) ( Gross {\&} Acquisti, 2005 ;  Tabibi, 2012 ). Despite the growing use of SNS data in the selection process, little theory or research has examined applicants' reactions to these practices. Thus, we used a model of privacy ( Stone {\&} Stone, 1990 ) to explain the factors that affect applicants' perceptions of invasion of privacy when SNS data are used in the hiring process. We also made minor additions to the model to fit the SNS context. The privacy model suggests that several information, procedural, sociocultural, and individual factors influence applicants' reactions, and we offer hypotheses based on the model to guide future research. We also consider the implications for establishing fair information policies, and balancing the needs of the organization for information against applicants' rights to privacy.","","Business And Economics--Labor And Industrial Relations,Employers,Human resources,Social networks","",""

While countries in the European Union all have established independent Data Protection Agencies (DPAs) to regulate the data security practices of companies, the United States has opted to allow the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to function as its own "de-facto" DPA pursuant to its preexisting consumer protection authority. The FTC has developed substantial expertise in the area of data security, but it remains constrained to a vague "reasonableness" standard when determining whether businesses that suffer data breaches have undertaken adequate security measures. This standard has faced resistance from companies that argue the FTC has not provided clear requirements for what security practices are required to avoid penalization. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates data security practices in the telecommunications industry, proposed a promising alternative enforcement model that imposed more specific standards on the target company in a recent data breach action. Not only did the FCC seek to eliminate the cause of that breach, but it also imposed clearly-defined security measures aimed at preventing future breaches from other foreseeable sources. Congress needs to modernize U.S. data legislation by affirmatively granting the FTC explicit authority over the data security practices of businesses. A new model under the FTC should take the FCC's approach as an example upon which to build, and create a more stringent, efficient data security framework that ensures companies constantly adapt to the latest technological innovations. The ultimate goal should be to keep personal data in the rightful control of consumers, many of whom do not yet realize the true value that it holds.","","Business,Communications,Companies,Consumer protection,Consumers,Data integrity,Global economy,Legislation,Legislatures,Modernization,Regulation,Resistance,Standards,Studies,Technological change,Telecommunications,Telecommunications industry,United States--US","",""

Although this is a difficult task that requires specialised skills, hackers continuously identify vulnerabilities and loopholes to gain access and conduct data breaches. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse1 recorded 901,010,077 data breaches since 2005, with only 5,220 data breaches made public.

The framework focuses on solutions towards optimal data sharing and integration while ensuring the security and privacy of individuals. Data sharing is based on the need-to-know principle, that is, data are only made available when they are required to perform core processes. To facilitate this, an approach is introduced in the form of a trusted third party that manages access control to personal information and thus helps to protect the privacy of individuals. It is argued that the proposed framework is suitable for data integration and sharing on various levels.

The distributed amount of data is constantly growing in everyday life including sensitive user's personal data. The amount of personal data in the comparison to the data flowing thru the communication lines daily may appear insignificant. However, every stored byte of personal data has the same importance as any other streams of data on the public or enterprise networks. The importance of person's data is too often underestimated and therefore handled without sufficient care. The awareness of data value and its underestimated data protection emerges immediately after data loss or data inaccessibility occurs. Data loss can happen in many different ways like careless handling of storage media or devices, hardware failure, ransomware etc. The most often appearing reason is accidental deletion of important files or overwriting the existing ones. We understand the term careless handling as keeping the data on single media without backup or using unreliable media like USB flash drives. According to the researches, the USB flash drives are the least appropriate media for data storage or protection due to their notorious unreliability and proneness to mechanical or electrical failures. However, making data backup on the USB flash drives is still very popular among the users despite of many accidental data loses. Irrespective from the way of losing data the importance of reliable backups is obvious. Unfortunately, the attitude toward reliable data protection is unsatisfying, sporadic or even not existing. Losing of data can be very inconvenient or disastrous for students or professional teachers. Especially in teacher's profession, it is very important to keep different data secured from unauthorized access or accidental loss. The aim of the surveys among the students ( future teachers) is to discover the habits in securing data. The gathered results show that the understanding of the importance of data backup among students is very low. The students ( future teachers) are very careless about securing their data. About 45 {\%} of students do not create any backups of their files. Around the third of the students, create backups only a few times in a year. Monthly backups are rather occasional appearances, only handful of students create regular backups. We have followed the trends thru the period of last three years and we could not see any significant shift toward better and reliable data protection. The attitude is the same for all the students and we could not find any differences dependent on the study. In general, students use two backup media: ( 1) USB Flash drive, and ( 2) the external hard drive. Some students use the PCs secondary hard disk as the backup destination. The students in our survey have acknowledged at least one event of data loss in certain period. Despite of losing data the student's general opinion is that data losses occur too rare to care about the backups. Some of the students protect only the crucial data and just a few students have established the reliable system for data protection.

This Article first examines the pervasiveness of the IoT and the data it collects in order to clarify the challenges facing regulators. It also highlights traditional privacy laws, principles, and regulations and explains why those rules do not fit the novel challenges and issues resulting from the IoT. Then it presents an in-depth analysis of four key FTC enforcement decisions to highlight how the FTC has and can regulate the IoT without undermining the innovation and benefits that this technology-and the data it provides- brings to our society. Specifically, the Article describes how the FTC, faced with the privacy challenge that accompanies the interconnected world of the IoT, has managed to apply traditional standards of "unfairness" and "deceptive practices" to protect private information. The FTC has been flexible and nimble with its interpretations of such standards and, in its most recent IoT case, FTC v. VIZIO, established a new "tool" in its toolkit for regulating IoT devices: an "unfair tracking" standard. As the de facto data protection authority in the United States, the FTC can use this new tool to work toward standardizing its treatment of IoT privacy issues instead of trying to fit those concerns neatly under the deception authority of section 5 of the FTC Act. However, this new tool also means that the FTC has the opportunity-and responsibility-to provide guidance on how it will wield that authority. To assure that innovation is not stifled and that this new rule is fairly applied (whether by the FTC or other agencies that may follow suit), it is imperative that the FTC diligently address concerns about the scope of this new rule and communicate that guidance to businesses, other regulators, and consumers alike. The new FTC administration should, as the primary regulator of information privacy and the IoT, continue the strong practice established by the previous administration, which is to provide guidance to businesses, consumers, and other regulators navigating the big challenges caused by the little things in the IoT.","","Automation,Computer privacy,Consumer protection,Consumers,Enforcement,Internet access,Internet of Things,Law,Personal information,Wireless access points","",""

The Court's interpretation of this notion had a considerable impact not only jon perception of the essence in other fields of law, but also on the constitutional doctrine more generally. This Article focuses on specificities of the notion of essence of fundamental rights to privacy and the protection of personal data from Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. After a general analysis, situating this notion into the framework of multi-level protection of fundamental rights in Europe, the Article addresses further interpretative challenges relating to the essence in the Court's case law. At the core of the analysis are the Schrems and Digital Rights Ireland cases, where the CJEU developed, for the first time, the modalities of the breach of essence of fundamental rights to privacy and data protection and laid down constitutional foundations for interpretation of this notion. Further jurisprudence, including the Tele2 Sverige and Opinion 1/15 cases, is analyzed as an example of fine-tuning of the CJEU's approach towards the normative understanding of this concept. Against this backdrop, the Article elaborates on the importance of insights in the fields of privacy and data protection for the general constitutional understanding of the concept of essence and proposes a generalized method for determination of infringement of essence in fundamental rights jurisprudence.","","Articles,Case law,Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU,Charters,Constitution,Constitutional law,Constitutions,Courts,Data,Data protection,Essence of fundamental rights,First time,Germany,Human rights,Infringement,Jurisprudence,Law,Privacy,Right of privacy,Schrems case,data protection,privacy","",""

The interdisciplinary approach is a unique feature and guarantees important new insights in the social, ethical and legal implications of these technologies for the individual and society as a whole. Its aim is to shed light on the tension between secrecy and transparency in the digital era. A special focus is put from the perspectives of psychology, medical ethics and European law on the contradiction between individuals' motivations for consented processing of personal data and their fears about unknown disclosure, transferal and sharing of personal data via information and communication technologies (named the "privacy paradox"). Potential benefits and harms for the individual and society resulting from the use of computers, mobile phones, the Internet and social media are being discussed. Furthermore, the authors point out the ethical and legal limitations inherent to the processing of personal data in a democratic society governed by the rule of law. Finally, they seek to demonstrate that the impact of information and communication technology use on the individuals' well-being, the latter being closely correlated with a high level of fundamental rights protection in Europe, is a promising feature of the socalled "e-democracy" as a new way to collectively attribute meaning to large-scale online actions, motivations and ideas.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","","Computer privacy,Data integrity,Ethics,Information technology,Philosophy","",""

Sharing their health data with their peers may support self-management, but the trust, identity, privacy and security (TIPS) considerations of people living with HIV remain underexplored. Working with a peer researcher who is expert in the lived experience of HIV, we interviewed 26 people living with HIV in the United Kingdom (UK) to investigate how to design a peer data sharing platform. We also conducted rating activities with participants to capture their attitudes towards sharing personal data. Our mixed methods study showed that participants were highly sophisticated in their understanding of trust and in their requirements for robust privacy and security. They indicated willingness to share digital identity attributes, including gender, age, medical history, health and well-being data, but not details that could reveal their personal identity. Participants called for TIPS measures to foster and to sustain responsible data sharing within their community. These findings can inform the development of trustworthy and secure digital platforms that enable people living with HIV to share data with their peers and provide insights for researchers who wish to facilitate data sharing in other communities with stigmatised health conditions.","","data sharing,health data,hiv,identity,privacy,security,trust","",""

However, in the digitally connected world the organisation is increasingly challenged to protect personal data and there is greater potential for inappropriate data use or disclosure, which can result in legal, financial, and reputational consequences for the organisation. Developments brought about by digital transformation increase the requirement for more stringent approaches to personal data protection to be implemented by the organisation. In most countries, data protection is taken very seriously and enforced through strict regulations (e.g. GDPR) which every organisation who holds personal data must adhere to. However, high-profile data breaches continue to occur. Research suggests that data protection controls have not kept pace with the degree to which organisations are experimenting with digital technologies and the unprecedented data volumes. Many organisations are unable to detect when or where their data systems have been breached. In order to comply with regulatory requirements to protect personal data and avoid potentially significant legal, financial, and reputational implications of a data breach, many organisations must improve their personal data protection approaches. This paper presents the key components or 'capability building blocks' of a conceptual framework in the area of Personal Data Protection (PDP) within the organisational context. This framework was developed based on the findings or themes that emerged from a systematic literature review (SLR) in this area followed by an open innovation approach. The resultant conceptual framework can be used by organisations to undertake a holistic analysis of their personal data protection capability. The framework also includes a set of POMs (Practices, Outcomes and Metrics) which acts as a roadmap for organisations to improve upon their current level of maturity in this area to effectively protect personal data and to demonstrate that the organisation is a trustworthy data custodian.","","Compliance,Computer privacy,Computer security,Computers--Computer Security,Councils,Data integrity,Data systems,Decision making,Europe,Fines {\&} penalties,General Data Protection Regulation,Information sharing,Literature reviews,Organizational aspects,Parliaments,Trends,Trustworthiness","",""

These purposes range from battling crime and terrorism to assessing public policy initiatives and enforcing regulatory regimes. To aid these efforts, governments are promoting mandatory retention and reporting of data by online service providers and the expansion of laws that facilitate wiretaps to greater portions of the web. The legal framework for protecting individual privacy within this growing world of big data is patchy and in critical ways outdated. Most of the current framework was erected in response to pronouncements by the Supreme Court over the years regarding the scope of constitutional privacy protections. Widespread agreement over the need for legislators to update the statutory regime has not yet produced results. Against this backdrop, the US Supreme Court has struggled in recent cases to articulate workable constitutional and statutory privacy norms that can help guide government, and individuals, in a world of digital and distributed data. An examination of the Court's privacy jurisprudence over the past forty years offers a number of insights into how the Court, and policy-makers, may achieve a balance between privacy and data use that accords with constitutional norms, serves vital public policy goals, and secures greater public trust and support.","","1210:Politics {\&} political behavior,4330:Litigation,5220:Information technology management,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9190:United States,Cloud computing,Law,Regulation,Right of privacy,Studies,Supreme Court decisions,Surveillance of citizens,United States--US","",""

Taking into account privacy calculus model and the risk/benefit ratio, we propose a model of users' trust in online social networks with four variables. We have adapted metrics for the purpose of our study and we have assessed their reliability and validity. We use a Partial Least Squares (PLS) based structural equation modelling analysis, which validated all our initial assumptions, indicating that our three predictors (privacy concerns, perceived benefits and perceived risks) explain 48{\%} of the variation of users' trust in online social networks, the resulting variable of our study.

Although on-chip bus encryption hardware can solve this problem, it requires hardware redesign or increases processor cost. Application redesign to prevent sensitive data from appearing on the processor-memory bus is extremely difficult. We propose and evaluate a processor-memory bus encryption technique for embedded systems that requires no changes to applications or hardware. This technique exploits cache locking or scratchpad memory, features present in many embedded processors, permitting the operating system (OS) virtual memory infrastructure to automatically encrypt data belonging to protected processes as they are written to off-chip memory. Pages belonging to unprotected processes are stored unencrypted to prevent performance and energy consumption penalties.We evaluate the proposed bus encryption technique using full system simulation. Experimental results indicate that it is possible to prevent the working data sets of processes from appearing on the processor-memory bus in plaintext, without using dedicated hardware and without changing applications. The OS based technique results in 1.37x slowdown for protected processes for processors with 512KB of L2 cache and 1.78x slowdown for processors with 256KB of L2 cache. There are negligible performance penalties for unprotected processes.","","","",""

However, the small form-factor, low-profile hardware interfaces and computational resources limit their capabilities in security checking. Many wristband devices have recently witnessed alarming vulnerabilities, e.g., personal data leakage and payment fraud, due to the lack of authentication and access control. To fill this gap, we propose a secure text pin input system, namely Taprint, which extends a virtual number pad on the back of a user's hand. Taprint builds on the key observation that the hand "landmarks'', especially finger knuckles, bear unique vibration characteristics when being tapped by the user herself. It thus uses the tapping vibrometry as biometrics to authenticate the user, while distinguishing the tapping locations. Taprint reuses the inertial measurement unit in the wristband, "overclocks'' its sampling rate to extrapolate fine-grained features, and further refines the features to enhance the uniqueness and reliability. Extensive experiments on 128 users demonstrate that Taprint achieves a high accuracy (96{\%}) of keystrokes recognition. It can authenticate users, even through a single-tap, at extremely low error rate (2.4{\%}), and under various practical usage disturbances.","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach – Building upon social exchange theory and privacy calculus theory, an integrated model was developed. The model was tested empirically using a sample of 405 social networking site's users. Users were required to complete a survey regarding self-disclosure behaviors in Facebook. Findings – The results indicate that social influence is the factor which exhibits the strongest effect on self-disclosure in social networking sites, followed by perceived benefits. Surprisingly, perceived privacy risk does not have any significant impact on self-disclosure. Research limitations/implications – The results inform researchers about the importance to incorporate social influence factors and cultural factors into future online self-disclosure study. Practical implications – The results suggest that users focus on the benefits as well as social influence when they decide to reveal personal information in social networking sites, but pay less attention to the potential privacy risks. Educators are advised to launch educational programs to raise students' awareness to the potential risks of self-disclosure in social networking sites.

However, aside from these rare examples, most medium and small internet-based business enterprises have grown with the dot.com bubble and dissolved when it burst mid-way through the decade. Now, at the 10th Anniversary of Electronic Commerce, after we have seen the dot.com way of doing business launch like a rocket and plunge like a comet, subsequently emerging into a more cautious, but no less potential, avenue of doing business, other challenges now face the industry as a whole to retain and obtain customers. Internet users are becoming increasingly wary of online transactions. 2 The irony is that as internet users become technologically savvy, they also become more aware of the dangers which connectivity entails and this inhibits their online behaviour. Chief among these concerns, and second only to cybercrimes, is the maintenance of privacy in the context of the protection of personal information, particularly from the unsavory elements trawling the cyberworld. For cyber-trade and the e-commerce market to grow, and for the continued efficiency and utility of the internet for G2C and B2C transactions, 3 governments and industries must re-instill the trust and confidence of internet users both in commercial and non-commercial interaction.4","","Technology: Comprehensive Works","",""

The Open Data movement is considered one of the keys to this change. To the best of our knowledge, the current generation of Open Data has to date provided only static datasets in which no data concerning specific individuals could be included, due to obvious privacy issues. Public administrations hold a great deal of data of a personal kind, as do many private entities. Consider, for instance, the huge amount of personal data contributed to the various online social networks, or the electricity consumption data collected and stored by energy providers, or the telephone and internet data collected by telecommunications companies. The lack of such personal data in the Open Data realm, and the static nature of the released datasets, are weaknesses of the current generation of Open Data. Without personal data and without timeliness, it is impossible to build useful services tailored to the actual needs of a given individual at a given time. We argue that, by segregating or "protecting" our personal data, those public and private entities become the "owners" of our data. This means they hold a monopoly on services, while we, the legitimate owners of the data, must abide by their terms and conditions concerning how our data are treated and used. By unleashing personal data "into the wild", such a monopoly would collapse and a new ecosystem of personal services based on these data could flourish. Of course nobody wants personal data to enter the public domain without any control. We argue that an appropriate policy for online disclosure of personal data is one where the individuals are restored to their role of "data owners" and are allowed to exert online control over data accesses being performed by third parties. This idea of "smart disclosure" of personal data is expected to be one of the forthcoming evolutions of Open Data. Based on the above arguments, we propose a possible implementation of "smart disclosure" that takes advantage of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework.

Fulfilling its mandate for data protection is not trivial, though. One approach for realizing this is the use of privacy design patterns. We have recently started consolidating such patterns into useful collections. In this paper we improve a subset of these, constructing a pattern system. This helps to identify contextually appropriate patterns. It better illustrates their application and relation to each other. The pattern system guides software developers, so that they can help users understand how their information system uses personal data. To achieve this, we rewrite our patterns to meet specific requirements. In particular, we add implementability and interconnection, while improving consistency and organization. This results in a system of patterns for informing users.","","pattern system, privacy by design, privacy design strategies, privacy patterns,data protection","",""

To help reduce these crash and crime statistics, roads technology is rapidly developing to prevent the former and deter the latter. This technology largely works by vehicle surveillance, and as with surveillance technology used in other arenas of crime prevention, drawbacks and dangers go along with the safety- and security-enhancing aspects. This paper reviews some key emerging roads technologies, the theoretical concerns raised by them and how, through various theoretical frameworks, they could be explored by the discipline of criminology. It urges that the surveillance aspects of road crime prevention and the study of vehicle-related crime more generally would benefit from criminological consideration and be theoretically rewarding. Moreover, in view of the centrality of the roads in contemporary life and the extent of global harm caused there, it contends that criminology should engage with this terrain.

One of the other significant advantages that this concept introduces is the cost saving part in respect to device purchasing, management and maintenance. Furthermore, because employees are more familiar with their own device the number of support calls should decrease and, with employee awareness programs, patching and updates will fall under their responsibility. Driven also by the growth of the number of mobile platforms available BYOD has the intent to provide customers and students ease of access to the organization's applications. Accessing information in real time irrespective of the location or time offers the potential to increase productivity. Having your entire workplace accessible through a thin client (app) on your phone or tablet would give you the opportunity to deliver your work using only an internet connection. In the same time BYOD introduces a series of concerns as now the perimeter of the network, becoming so volatile, would be harder to secure. Having personal devices accessing the internal assets of the organization from anywhere leaves doors open to unauthorized access, malware attacks or information leakage. In the end in order for organizations to adopt and implement BYOD, there has to be a compelling business case to support it and the rewards must outweigh the risks.","","Cellular telephones,Internet access,Organizational behavior,Quality of work,Sciences: Comprehensive Works","",""

In this era of information, companies treat personal data as a prized commodity, leveraging its potential to boost business and engage an evergrowing number of customers. Yet when companies fail to protect the sensitive data that they hold, consumers are left with few avenues to obtain redress for the harms they may have suffered. In an effort to protect consumers, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been policing inadequate data security practices since the early 2000s. Using its broad authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC routinely brings enforcement actions against companies that have sustained data breaches, yet could have implemented reasonable security measures to prevent them. In the vast majority of proceedings, the violating entity chooses to settle with the FTC rather than incur the various costs associated with litigation. The orders that accompany the conclusion of every enforcement proceeding typically require the violator to enact a comprehensive data security overhaul. In 2018, such an FTC order was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On the heels of this decision, it is apparent that the FTC must recalibrate its approach to enforcing unlawful data security practices. This Comment contends that the Commission should draw on its substantial experience with data protection and promulgate a rule that transparently specifies the standard by which data security is to be regulated. Although the FTCs decision to abstain from using its Magnuson-Moss rulemaking authority may have been prudent in the early days of its foray into data security, times have changed. Embracing the heightened public participation interwoven throughout the hybrid rulemaking process, the FTC is fully capable of delineating a data security standard in a reasonable amount of time. And once the rule-based standard is in place, the FTC can reap the benefits of a framework that provides the regulated community with enhanced guidance and the consumer public with greater protection from preventable data harms.","","Consumer protection,Consumers,Data integrity,Enforcement,Fair Credit Reporting Act 1970-US,Financial Services Modernization Act 1999-US,Identity theft,Judicial reviews,Privacy,Public Administration,United States--US","",""

The study is concluded by identifying the most significant practical applications. The GDPR implies very important new rules that will be applied across the EU and that will directly affect every Member State. Furthermore, its aim is to overcome the existing fragmented regulations and to modernise the principles of privacy in the European Union. The practical and social implications of the GDPR are very significant, as it constitutes a single and updated set of rules applicable in the whole of the EU and for all the data processing of European citizens. It seeks to avoid the fragmentation of the EU market and to facilitate cross-border business and corporate activity, the free circulation of personal data and a greater guarantee of the fundamental rights and freedoms of European citizens. In the interest of European citizens, it regulates the rights to access, rectify, delete and object and it recognises two new rights: to be digitally forgotten and data portability.","","European union,General Data Protection Regulation,Privacy,Religions And Theology--Roman Catholic,data protection,fundamental rights,general regulation on data protection,lawyer","",""

The new laws introduce in many respects stricter data protection regulations alongside stronger enforcement powers, and if organizations have not already done so, now is the time for them to review and amend their data protection practices to ensure compliance with the new laws. This article explains and analyses the major changes of relevance to private sector organizations (within and outside of Australia), including a broader interpretation of the extra-territorial application of the laws, a wider definition of personal information, increased enforcement powers for the regulator, the introduction of a new set of privacy principles, the incorporation of the concept of privacy by design as well as revised rules for cross-border data flows and direct marketing. Significant new credit reporting provisions were also introduced. These are not the subject of this article but they are equally important for organizations to be aware of and address. Overall, the new Australian privacy regime is more aligned with the EU data protection regime and deserves to be viewed as a relatively strong data protection regime. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that the revised laws will receive a positive adequacy determination by the EU Commission in the context of cross-border data transfers unless and until further changes recommended for consideration as part of a second stage of the reform process are accepted and implemented.","","4310:Regulation,5140:Security management,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9179:Asia {\&} the Pacific,Australia,Consumer protection,Data integrity,Law,Private sector,Public sector,Regulatory reform,Right of privacy,Studies","",""

To this end, we investigated the patrons' understanding of library usage records and determined the relationship between different user characteristics and privacy knowledge or leaks. The results show that a high number of patrons perceived these records as their own private information, but that there was no necessity for legal procedures or consent for the use of these records. Also, even though the understanding of these usage records showed that there was a relationship between the frequency of library visits and leaks of personal information, the correlation was not particularly strong.","","Academic libraries,Computer privacy,Economic models,Leaks,Librarians,Libraries,Library Patron,Library Record,Personal Information,Privacy,Public Library,Technology: Comprehensive Works,User Privacy","",""

While privacy has long been considered a "universal,"1 it is also labelled a "chameleonlike word,"2 "protean,"3 "ephemeral,"4 a "black box,"5 a "haystack in a hurricane,"6 and a "broad and somewhat evanescent concept."7 One wonders if a definition is possible or even necessary given that privacy instruments, such as the statutory privacy torts in Canada, do not state what privacy means.8 Some scholars have nobly attempted definitions,9 while others contend that any attempt to circumscribe privacy in a uniform and monolithic manner would undermine the richness, context-dependency, fluidity and malleability of the concept.10   27 Kristien Hens et al, "Developing a Policy for Paediatric Biobanks: Principles for Good Practice" (2013) 21 European Journal of Human Genetics 2 [Hens et al, "Principles"]; [Edward S Dove], Yann Joly {\&} [Bartha M Knoppers], "Power to the People: A Wiki-Governance Model for Biobanks" (2012) 13 Genome Biology 158; Peter H Watson {\&} Rebecca O Barnes, "A Proposed Schema for Classifying Human Research Biobanks" (2011) 9:4 Biopreservation and Biobanking 327; Catherine Heeney, "Dynamic Networks of Practice" in Jane Kaye et al, Governing Biobanks: Understanding the Interplay between Law and Practice (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2012) 93 [Kaye et al, Governing Biobanks]; Susan MC Gibbons, "Regulating Biobanks: A Twelve-Point Typological Tool" (2009) 17:3 Med L Rev 313. See also James R Griesemer {\&} Susan Leigh Star, "Institutional Ecology, 'Translations' and Boundary Objects: Amateurs and Professionals in Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, 1907-39" (1989) 19:3 Social Studies of Science 387 (describing boundary objects as entities that can be interpreted in different ways by different communities but are robust enough to maintain an identity across them).   59 Privacy legislation generally defines "personal information" or "health information" as "recorded information about an identifiable individual" or "identifying information about an individual in oral or recorded form." A contrario, information about non-identifiable individuals, e.g. anonymous or anonymized information, does not fall under the purview of the legislation. See e.g. Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004, SO 2004, c 3, Sch A, s 4(2) ("'identifying information' means information that identifies an individual or for which it is reasonably foreseeable in the circumstances that it could be utilized, either alone or with other information, to identify an individual") [Ontario PHIPA]. A plain and ordinary meaning of "information" demonstrates that biological samples are not recorded information - only information extracted from those biological samples can be interpreted as recorded information (assuming it is documented in paper or electronic format and linked to an identifiable individual). Thus, most privacy statutes will not prima facie apply to genetic material or other biological samples collected for a biobank, though given DNA can be digitalized, a broad interpretation could apply. The current bi-modal legislative framework (i.e. "identifiable" information affords legal protection, "non-identifiable" information does not) affords clarity and predictability but little justification. Residual privacy interests may exist even in anonymized genetic information or biospecimens, given that Canadian Charter jurisprudence views privacy as forming a part of one's fundamental right to dignity, integrity and autonomy. See generally R v Mills, [1999] 3 SCR 668, 180 DLR (4th) 1; R v O'Connor, [1995] 4 SCR 411, 130 DLR (4th) 235; R v Plant. [1993] 3 SCR 281, 84 CCC (3d) 203. Identifiability, especially in the genomics field, exists on a continuum, and everevolving de- and re-identification techniques will continue to challenge and undermine the bi-modal model.","","Canada,Children {\&} youth,Medical databases,Medical research,Pediatrics,Personal information,Physical Fitness And Hygiene,Privacy","",""

In addition, the EU lawmaker intends to adopt specific rules to protect confidentiality of communications, in a separate ePrivacy Regulation. Some have argued that there is no need for such additional rules for communications confidentiality.This Article discusses the protection of the right to confidentiality of communications in Europe. We look at the right's origins to assess the rationale for protecting it. We also analyze how the right is currently protected under the European Convention on Human Rights and under EU law.We show that at its core the right to communications confidentiality protects three individual and collective values: privacy, freedom of expression, and trust in communication services. The right aims to ensure that individuals and organizations can safely entrust communication to service providers. Initially, the right protected only postal letters, but it has gradually developed into a strong safeguard for the protection of confidentiality of communications, regardless of the technology used.Hence, the right does not merely serve individual privacy interests, but also other more collective interests that are crucial for the functioning of our information society. We conclude that separate EU rules to protect communications confidentiality, next to the GDPR, are justified and necessary.","","Confidentiality,Europe,General Data Protection Regulation,Law,Privacy","",""

The protective purpose of the GDPR is to enable individuals, against the background of modern data processing possibilities and techniques and their risks, to decide for or against a consent to data processing on the basis of appropriate information on how their personal data are handled and in a self-determined manner.

Information security primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of stored data (CIA). Cloud system is one of the platforms that provides a database as a service (DBaaS), typically it takes care of scalability and high availability of the database. The confidentiality and integrity of stored data is still not guaranteed by some cloud systems because there is no trust between data owners and third-party platforms (Cloud systems). CryptDBaaS is a security model integrating cloud computing with cryptography to provide a security mechanism for data owners, which aims to guarantee the confidentiality of stored data in the cloud from unauthorized access or misuse of data from third party. CryptDBaaS model illustrates how to encrypt your data before storing it using secure and suitable encryption algorithms based on data type and allows to execute queries and performs some mathematical and logical operations over encrypted database. CryptDBaaS is evaluated by conducting a simulation to measure performance and accuracy of queries and search techniques CryptDBaaS provides. Evaluation step shows that CryptDBaaS has a high performance with respect to the encryption and search algorithms. The queries are executed as if they were executed over plain text data, so the obtained accuracy is 100{\%} for all queries and operators except the search one which has 50{\%} or 100{\%} of accuracy based on chosen technique.","","DBaaS security, cloud, cloud security, database security, encrypted database,DBaaS","",""

The goal of this paper is to develop organizational and legal measures aimed at improving the security of electronic payments in the Russian Federation. Research methods include the analysis of retrospective data describing the development of the payment system and electronic payments using bank cards, as well as the method of statistical observations and analysis of secondary data from surveys of Russian and foreign companies covering the information security. Through solving the research problems, the author managed to draw a number of conclusions: * Dynamic development of the electronic payment system causes the growth of cybercrime and cyber risks in payment systems; * Despite quite active actions of state bodies and the Bank of Russia, the legal framework and infrastructure for electronic payments are still in the development stage; * Cyber attacks cause significant damage not only to financial institutions, but also to companies from a nonfinancial sector, as well as to ordinary citizens using electronic payment systems. In the opinion of the author, the key organizational and legal measures aimed at mitigating cyber risks in electronic payments may be measures to form the centralized payment infrastructure of the Bank of Russia, introduce the corporate cyber threat management systems, improve policies and procedures for the protection of personal data at the corporate level, as well as train the employees in the field of information security of electronic settlements.","","45411:Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses,Economic summit conferences,Electronic commerce,India,Infrastructure,International conferences,Internet,Law,Mobile commerce,Network security,Payment systems,Privacy,Research methodology,Russia,Smartphones,Transfer of funds,Trends,United Kingdom--UK","",""

Electronic banking systems provide fast, safe enough and relatively low-cost service operations. Reimbursement for goods and services using e-instruments is increasing. The paper analyzes new ICT which ensure the development of new security means in e-payment operations and the risk rising in possible security disturbances. Safety support systems--authenticity, authorization, confidentiality, control, auditing, integrity, and minimal benefits for e-payment--must be designed and applied according to the safety requirements and standards that must be always updated and improved. The European Union (EU) focuses on the protection of the data of natural and legal persons in order to keep e-services safe and sound. EU legal acts which determine the financial payment involving data and information security standards and criteria are important for all EU Member States. E-banking systems ensure a prompt and adequate performance of safe financial transactions. Statistical data are analyzed in order to evaluate the situation, i.e. to find out how virtual currency transfers and payments for goods and services using e-instruments are increasing on a large scale. Technological development of e-payment increases the possibilities of quick and qualitative transfers, but cyber-security requirements and their implementation technologies are essential issues to be considered. Despite all security measures, threats to the security of e-payments are real and very serious. Systems 'cracking' tools and techniques are no less technologically advanced than their countermeasures. Most developed countries around the world pay much attention to the security of 'sensitive' information. One of the categories of this kind of information is financial data. The article discusses risk factors in assessing safety measures for financial payment. The authors analyze some ways in which software and hardware measures can be used for retrieving personal data by falsifying e-payment instruments, misleading the users of financial systems and directing them to websites with dangerous content.

The purpose of this paper is to examine variables predicting anxiety about data hacking, and the role that such anxiety and other potentially important variables have in explaining the use of digital privacy protection behavior.Design/methodology/approachIn total, 305 participants from an online labor market were sampled who frequently use the internet, surveyed about recent anxiety (using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7)), anxiety about data hacking (GAD-7, in reference to data hacking), and issues of digital privacy: news exposure, perceived importance, self-efficacy, protection behavior, and previous hacking victimization.FindingsProfession (information technology-related) moderated the symptom structure for recent anxiety, but not data hacking anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, prior hacking victimization predicted anxiety about hacking. Digital privacy protection behavior was related to hacking anxiety and privacy self-efficacy. Data hacking anxiety mediated relations between hacking victimization and privacy protection. Privacy self-efficacy mediated relations between news exposure to hacking incidents and privacy protection.Research limitations/implicationsLimitations include the self-report nature of the instruments, and use of a selective, non-random sample.Practical implicationsResults highlight knowledge, self-efficacy, and threat appraisal among IT managers in motivating better digital security practices.Originality/valueThis is the first study using a standardized instrument of anxiety to examine distress about hacking and predictors of digital privacy protection behavior.","","14.13:COMPUTERS,33:Internet and Intranet Applications (CI),Anxiety,Computer privacy,Computer security,Computers--Internet,Consumer protection,Consumers,Data integrity,Digital technology,Information management,Mobile commerce,Personal information,Privacy,Smartphones,Social networks,Social research,United States--US,User behavior,Virtual private networks","",""

To reduce the risk of such incidents, security policies are often employed to regulate access to information. Such policies, however, are often too restrictive, and users do not have the rights necessary to perform assigned duties. As a consequence, access control mechanisms are perceived by users as a barrier and thus bypassed, making the system insecure. In this paper, we draw a bridge between the social concept of conviviality and access control. Conviviality has been introduced as a social science concept for ambient intelligence and multi-agent systems to highlight soft qualitative requirements like user-friendliness of systems. To bridge the gap between conviviality and security, we propose a methodological framework for updating and adapting access control policies based on conviviality recommendations. Our methodology integrates and extends existing techniques to assist system designers in the derivation of access control policies from socio-technical requirements of the system, while taking into account the conviviality of the system. We illustrate our framework using the Ambient Assisted Living use case from the HotCity of Luxembourg.","","Access control,Computers--Software,Conviviality,Information,Internet access,Negotiable and non-negotiable authorizations,Requirement model,Security","",""

One estimate is that 10 million customers are victims of identity theft each year. In fact, it is difficult to avoid news on public disclosure of security breaches to corporate databases that companies made in 2005. A typical example was the backup computer tape containing personal data for 3.9 million customers that was lost by the world's largest financial services company in transit by courier to a credit reporting bureau. Consumers are clearly alarmed and some are switching banks or changing their online behavior in order to protect their identity. As a result, there is increased pressure on organizations to improve data security and therefore provide customers with some assurance that their personal information will not be misappropriated. This paper discusses identity theft and the risk to consumers as well as current efforts by federal and state governments to protect the privacy of their constituents. It offers steps that could be taken by organizations to protect their most critical asset - customer information - against identity theft.

Bulky chest straps and large wristbands are going the way of flip cellphones and floppy disks. In the near future, for example, it may be commonplace for athletes to wear Biostamps or smart T-shirts with embedded sensors during practices, games, and even sleep. And while athletic competitors may have been one of the first movers in the area, health care, the military, and the industrial sector have all begun to use wearables to harness vast treasure troves of information destined to provide highly individualized feedback. The possibilities are almost endless when such personal information is combined with big data analytics in the name of improving large-scale efficiency. Interestingly, employers were one of the first movers in the wearable revolution. Yet, other than basic tracking of people and goods, there is still a tremendous potential for expansion. What if wearables could be harnessed to assist employees in avoiding conflict of interests? What if wearables could assist employees in identifying ethical dilemmas and could then prompt them to consider alternative courses of action? What if the wearable evolution became an ethical revolution? But the drawbacks of using wearables in such a manner must also be critically analyzed. This Article takes this step by exploring the use of wearables as personal information gathering devices that feed into larger data sets. It then considers some of the legal and policy implications of the use and aggregation of data in such a manner and ultimately makes suggestions for bottom-up baseline regulation. Ultimately, we argue for the desirability of leveraging this emerging technology, subject to privacy and security safeguards, to help drive an ethical revolution in business cultures.","","2410:Social responsibility,5250:Telecommunications systems {\&} Internet communi,9130:Experiment/theoretical treatment,Employees,Ethics,Internet crime,Privacy,Studies,Technology: Comprehensive Works,Wearable computers","",""

It protects the rights of content owners by allowing only authorised consumers to legitimately access associated digital content. DRM systems typically use a consumer's identity for authentication. In addition, some DRM systems collect consumer's preferences to obtain a content license. Thus, the behaviour of DRM systems disadvantages the digital content consumers (i.e. neglecting consumers' privacy) focusing more on securing the digital content (i.e. biased towards content owners). This paper proposes the Privacy-Preserving Digital Rights Management System (PrivDRM) that allows a consumer to acquire digital content with its license without disclosing complete personal information and without using any third parties. To evaluate the performance of the proposed solution, a prototype of the PrivDRM system has been developed and investigated. The security analysis (attacks and threats) are analysed and showed that PrivDRM supports countermeasures for well-known attacks and achieving the privacy requirements. In addition, a comparison with some well-known proposals shows that PrivDRM outperforms those proposals in terms of processing overhead.","","Consumer's rights, Content Owner, Digital Content, Privacy-preserving, Security,Digital Rights Management","",""

This paper aims to examine how compensating consumers for their personal information affects their expectations for data ownership and privacy control. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conduct two online scenario-based experiments with a sample of adult consumers. The results were analyzed using multivariate and univariate analysis of variance. Findings - The findings show that receiving compensation, especially when it is a monetary reward, reduces consumer expectations for privacy protection. These effects depend on whether the information provided to marketers is perceived to be sensitive in nature. Originality/value - While a number of privacy studies have investigated the effects of compensation on encouraging self-disclosure on the internet, there is a lack of research that examines the effect of compensation on privacy expectations. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to test empirically the construct of information ownership in the context of privacy exchanges.","","7000:Marketing,8331:Internet services industry,9130:Experimental/theoretical,Business And Economics--Marketing And Purchasing,Compensation,Consumers,Internet,Marketing,Privacy,Right of privacy,Social networks,Studies","",""

We found that users do little to protect their data. While they seem confident about the type of data being collected, they are unsure about how it is being used. Understandably, users are more comfortable sharing their data with friends and work colleagues. We also found that users differentiate between the types of data they are willing to share, suggesting a need for improved sharing preferences. When considering scenarios describing data uses with security and privacy implications, participants recognized that many scenarios were plausible but frequently felt that the scenarios were unlikely to occur.

Further, companies may incur costs resulting from litigation stemming from the potential liability exposure. For these reasons, an examination of the stock market's assessment of the costs of data breaches is warranted. One of the most significant events in the history of data breaches occurred at ChoicePoint. In February 2005, ChoicePoint, self-described as the "nation's leading provider of identification and credential verification services" (ChoicePoint, 2006), disclosed that thieves had created false accounts for the purpose of obtaining personal information with which to commit identity theft and subsequent fraud. Initially, ChoicePoint estimated that the information of 140,000 people had been compromised, and at the time of the announcement, more than 700 documented instances of identity theft had already been directly linked to the data breach (Weber, 2005). Since that time, the incidence of exposures that could lead to identity theft has noticeably increased. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer information and advocacy organization, estimates more than 440 instances of reported exposures to potential identity theft have occurred between the February 2005 ChoicePoint incident and December 2006 due to data breaches at corporations, universities, and government agencies. The organization further estimates that the number of records exposed in these breaches exceeds 100 million (Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, 2007).","","3400:Investment analysis {\&} personal finance,4300:Law,5200:Communications {\&} information management,8200:Insurance industry,9190:United States,Data integrity,Effects,Employees,Insurance,Insurance industry,Personal information,Shareholders wealth,United States--US","",""

Design/methodology/approach  - This paper approaches legal issues from the perspective of the consumer or citizen.  Findings  - While conducting research for this paper, it was found that the issues facing the citizenry on privacy protection have been addressed extensively in the not too distant past. The distinguishing characteristic is the speed with which data can be collected and disseminated and the infinitely more vast amount of personal data being collected not only by the government and businesses with whom consumers conduct transactions, but also by independent data brokers.  Originality/value  - Privacy rights are ephemeral and difficult to measure. Businesses, therefore, appear to have difficulty determining the value of protecting consumers' privacy. Additionally, governments from which citizens derive many social services accumulate substantial personal information given in exchange for those services. Businesses and governments are increasingly negligent in protecting the data collected on individuals, which has been revealed by a series of reported data breaches, disclosures, thefts, and surveillance activities. This paper addresses the inherent value in protecting the privacy interests of individuals and proposes that more robust privacy laws, derived from established tort law, be developed and used by concerned persons.

So far, more than ten mobile based health care services are deployed in low-income countries. Among those, mobile data collection is the one used to replace traditional paper form based data collection with electronic digital forms by the use of Mobile Data Collection Systems (MDCS). However, although such systems are often used to collect sensitive health-related data, critical issues like security and privacy of personal data have not been systematically addressed. Particularly, very little has been done to protect data while stored on the phone. This paper focuses on low budget mobile phones with low hardware and software specification, and proposes adequate secure solutions for data storage protection. Our secure storage scheme is flexible enough to be integrated in existing mobile client applications. The solution has been extensively tested and integrated into a production MDCS.

Cloud services, however, move data to remote, potentially unknown, locations maintained by third parties. The responsibility for data protection and integrity no longer remains exclusively with its owner or licensee, but with these third parties. Thus, both parties must identify and manage the many regulatory requirements that govern their services and products in this multi-jurisdictional environment. To simplify this problem, we are developing methods to extract and codify regulatory requirements from government laws. We apply previously validated metrics to measure gaps and overlaps between the codified regulations. Our findings include a semi-formalization of the legal landscape using operational constructs for high- and low-watermark practices, which correspond to high- and low standards of care, respectively. Business analysts and system developers can use these watermarks to reason about compliance trade-offs based on perceived businesses costs and risks.

Introduction In the age of the Internet consumer market, merchants and service providers hold increasing amounts of private personal data in their databases and on their servers.1 With this vast amount of data storage comes increased risk that thieves and rouges, from both inside and outside a custodian entity, will breach the security protecting individual personal information.2 Because the federal Class Action Fairness Act ("CAFA") provides a lower threshold for Article Ill diversity jurisdiction in multistate class actions than in traditional diversity suits, many data breach cases are brought in federal district courts.3 As courts of limited jurisdiction, the district courts are required to ensure cases are properly before them as a threshold matter.4 Among other required components of proper jurisdiction, plaintiffs must have standing to sue.5 Plaintiffs bear the burden of showing standing at every stage of litigation, and must allege sufficient facts to support their right to sue at the pleading stage or risk dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).6 In data breach class actions, often the most difficult aspect of standing for plaintiffs to adequately allege is that they have suffered an "injury in fact.

Many social media sites provide specialty forums for the sick to interact with their peers. Unfortunately, these sites are mostly unregulated environments where advertisers can prey on the desperate but unwary, people can provide their unwarranted but seemingly authoritative medical opinions, and clinicians can troll for cohorts for their studies. These sites also encourage users to share personal and private medical information; oftentimes that medical information implicates not only the immediate patient, but also her extended family members who might be similarly experiencing, but more privately, the same or similar medical conditions. Just like social media brings medical consultancy to the masses, smartphones have brought medical diagnostics to just about anyone who can download a mobile device software application (app). Diagnostic and other medical apps often take advantage of the evershrinking size of wearable technologies, as well as advances in computing that can offer doctors, patients, and third parties powerful medical tools on their portable computing devices. The FDA has provided little to no guidance in the Wild West of patient related social media sites. Although it has issued voluntary guidelines for apps intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent diseases many questions remain unanswered. Without clear rules for these relatively new classes of medical devices, and with the threat of regulatory and monetary repercussions for app developers, the FDA may be chilling development of new and useful medically related applications. Both patient-oriented social media sites and many mobile medical applications (MMAs) are particularly useful and relevant for the growing class of chronically ill patients. While the potential for heavy-handed regulation of MMAs may chill development in this area and hurt this aforementioned population, the lack of any oversight in patient oriented social media sites may also potentially harm this demographic by not enforcing any filter to a largely lay and desperate population. This paper will provide brief reviews of the state of the art for these medically related technologies and review the regulatory and legal aspects of these similar but distinct technologies. The paper will suggest both a hybrid regulatory and technological solution for MMAs and a mostly-regulatory solution for policing patient oriented social media sites. These proposed rules will also take into account related issues such as evolving social norms, including the rapid rise of the quantified-self-trend and changes in perceptions of privacy.","","92615:Regulation,Applications programs,Bleeding,Computation,Consultancy services,Cooling,Demographics,Diagnostic software,Diagnostic systems,Digital media,Doctors,Downloading,Electronic health records,Family medical history,Licensing,Medical devices,Mobile communication systems,Norms,Patients,Perceptions,Portable equipment,Privacy,Regulation,Smartphones,Social networks,Software utilities,Technology: Comprehensive Works,United States--US,Wearable technology,and Inspection of Miscellaneous Commercial Sector","",""

Despite international trends towards greater protection of personal information, significant challenges to personal privacy arise in this context. These include the use of outsourcing by businesses, the encroachment of security laws and the potential 'spill-over' of technologies developed for combating terrorism into the private sector. Also significant are technologies enabling the 'profiling' of individuals and 'data mining' across borders. Against this backdrop, the article considers existing jurisdictional responses towards regulating personal information flows across borders. It considers various actual or proposed solutions including 'safe-harbours', contractual mechanisms and extra-territorial applications. The article concludes that many of the existing approaches to regulating trans-border information flows are to some extent deficient and suggests the need for a new 'fourth generation' set of data protection protocols. In formulating the latter, analogies are drawn from other relevant areas of the law in order to furnish creative solutions to the problem.","","Technology: Comprehensive Works","",""

Despite international trends towards greater protection of personal information significant challenges to personal privacy arise in this context. These include the use of outsourcing by businesses, the encroachment of security laws and the potential 'spill-over' of technologies developed for combating terrorism into the private sector. Also significant are technologies enabling the 'profiling' of individuals and 'data mining' across borders. Against this backdrop the article considers existing jurisdictional responses towards regulating personal information flows across borders. It considers various actual or proposed solutions including 'safe-harbours', contractual mechanisms and extra-territorial applications. The article concludes that many of the existing approaches to regulating trans-border information flows are to some extent deficient and suggests the need for a new 'fourth generation' set of data protection protocols. In formulating the latter, analogies are drawn from other relevant areas of the law in order to furnish creative solutions to the problem.","","Technology: Comprehensive Works","",""

Examples of private information that may be at risk can draw the users' attention to relevant information for a decision and also improve their response. We present two experiments that validate this approach in the context of Android app permissions. Private information that becomes accessible given certain permissions is displayed when a user wants to install an app, demonstrating the consequences this installation might have. We find that participants made more privacy-conscious choices when deciding which apps to install.

Our findings demonstrate that anonymization is applied to data far less pervasively than expected. Organizations that do employ anonymization often view their practices as sensitive and resort to anonymity by obscurity alongside technical means. Rather than being a purely technical question of applying the right algorithms, anonymization in practice is a complex socio-technical process that relies on multi-stakeholder collaborations.

Since the dawn of the internet, Congress has repeatedly failed to build a robust identity for American privacy law.  "2 Data protection regimes that follow the GDPR typically follow what Margot Kaminski calls a "binary governance" approach that combines individual due process rights with a collaborative governance approach to follow and protect personal data to ensure it is always processed fairly.3 Data protection regimes long predate the GDPR, but the GDPR has had the unexpected effect of turning European-style privacy protection into a global market norm, an example of what Anu Bradford has termed the "Brussels Effect," and what Paul Schwartz calls "global data privacy the EU way.  "7 Ye t t h e U.S. Congress has not updated its rules and permissive "notice and choice" approach to privacy in years.8 Instead, states have taken the mantle and have begun creating their own data protection legislation.9 At least partially as a result of the Brussels Effect, American state legislatures have started to pass state-level data protection statutes, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).10 The CCPA applies in California, but because many companies are either headquartered in or do business in Silicon Valley's home state, it will have national consequences when it comes into effect in 2020.11 Other states like Washington have also begun to consider their own mini-GDPRs, and after years of opposition to regulation, big tech companies have started to call for a baseline privacy law.12 These calls are often paired with arguments for federal preemption to avoid multiple state data governance regimes, particularly from more aggressive state regulators.13 Although preemption advocates often claim that unification will help make U.S. privacy laws adequate in the eyes of the EU, any omnibus bill that is likely to be passed seems destined to be a watered-down version of the GDPR, given the trans-Atlantic differences in rights, cultures, commitments, and regulatory appetites.14 Congress now finds itself sandwiched between bottom-up momentum from the states, and top-down influence from emerging international norms and foreign law.  In this Article, we suggest that something analogous is happening in privacy law in the United States-after decades of accommodating the internet and digital technologies into existing and often poorly fitting legal structures, we are on the cusp of a set of legal changes that will structure our emergent digital society for decades to come.19 It might seem at this point like there is not much of a decision to be made regarding the identity of U.S. privacy law.","","Accountability,Big Data,California,Citizen participation,Constitutional law,Consumer protection,Data processing,Digital currencies,Europe,Federalism,General Data Protection Regulation,Law,Preemption,Privacy,Silicon Valley-California,Social networks,United States--US","",""

Yet, the sharing of one's genetic data for research is a voluntary act. The collection of data sufficient to fuel rapid advancement is contingent on individuals' willingness to share. Privacy risks associated with sharing this unique and intensely personal data are significant. Genetic data are an unambiguous identifier. Public linkage of donor to their genetic data could reveal predisposition to diseases, behaviors, paternity, heredity, intelligence, etc. The purpose of this paper is to understand individuals' willingness to volunteer their private information in this high-risk/high-reward context.Design/methodology/approachThe authors collect survey data from 273 respondents and use structural equation modeling techniques to analyze responses.FindingsThe authors find statistical support for our theorization. They find that while heightened awareness of the benefits and risks of sharing correlates with increased privacy concerns, the net impact is an increase in intention to share.Social implicationsThe findings suggest that prescriptive awareness might be an effective tool with which policy-makers can gain the sufficient voluntary participation from individuals necessary to drive large-scale medical research.Originality/valueThis study contributes a theoretically and empirically informed model which demonstrates the impact of awareness and privacy concern on individuals' willingness to share their genetic data for large-scale HGR.

Three principles in Western law are relevant for video recording in health care practice: (1) regulations on privacy regarding personal data, which apply to the gathering and processing of video data in health care settings; (2) the patient record, in which video data can be stored; and (3) professional secrecy, which protects the privacy of patients including video data. Practical implementation of these principles in video recording in health care does not exist.

We have designed and implemented a prototype technology platform for providing home-based healthcare services. It supports a personal electronic health diary and enables secure and reliable communication and interaction with peers and healthcare personnel. The platform runs on a small computer with a dedicated remote control. It is connected to the patient's TV and to a broadband Internet. The platform has been tested with home-based rehabilitation and education programs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. As part of our work, a risk assessment of privacy and security aspects has been performed, to reveal actual risks and to ensure adequate information security in this technical platform.   Methods: Risk assessment was performed in an iterative manner during the development process. Thus, security solutions have been incorporated into the design from an early stage instead of being included as an add-on to a nearly completed system. We have adapted existing risk management methods to our own environment, thus creating our own method. Our method conforms to ISO's standard for information security risk management.   Results: A total of approximately 50 threats and possible unwanted incidents were identified and analysed. Among the threats to the four information security aspects: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and quality; confidentiality threats were identified as most serious, with one threat given an unacceptable level of High risk. This is because health-related personal information is regarded as sensitive. Availability threats were analysed as low risk, as the aim of the home programmes is to provide education and rehabilitation services; not for use in acute situations or for continuous health monitoring.   Conclusions: Most of the identified threats are applicable for healthcare services intended for patients or citizens in their own homes. Confidentiality risks in home are different from in a more controlled environment such as a hospital; and electronic equipment located in private homes and communicating via Internet, is more exposed to unauthorised access. By implementing the proposed measures, it has been possible to design a home-based service which ensures the necessary level of information security and privacy.","","Chronic Disease -- rehabilitation,Chronic Disease -- therapy,Computer Security -- legislation {\&} jurisprudence,Computer Security -- standards,Confidentiality,Health Insurance Portability {\&} Accountability Act,Home Care Services -- legislation {\&} jurisprudence,Home Care Services -- standards,Humans,Medical Sciences--Computer Applications,Models, Statistical,Outcome {\&} Process Assessment (Health Care) -- meth,Outcome {\&} Process Assessment (Health Care) -- stan,Patient Education as Topic,Qualitative Research,Risk Assessment -- methods,United States","",""

As smartphones and mobile applications continually redefine the digital landscape, attempts to apply the decades-old anti-hacking statute in this new territory have created potentially disturbing precedent. Courts and critics have struggled to interpret the arguably vague and ambiguous provisions of the CFAA and have turned to contract law, agency law, and computer science for guidance. This Comment contends that the contract- and agency-based interpretations implicate constitutional vagueness concerns, and the code-based approach does not sufficiently address "insider" misuse of information. In the context of mobile application data privacy, the shortcomings of current interpretations necessitate a narrower view of unauthorized access. By limiting liability to only traditional notions of hacking and serious misuse of information, the CFAA can better serve its original and primary purpose: punishing criminal computer hackers and those who abuse legitimate access rights.

It's just someone else's computer.” Despite the loss of control that comes with its use, critical records are increasingly being entrusted to the cloud, generating ever-growing concern about the privacy and security of those records. Ultimately, privacy and security constitute an attempt to balance competing needs: privacy balances the need to use information against the need to protect personal data, while security balances the need to provide access to records against the need to stop unauthorized access. The importance of these issues has led to a multitude of legal and regulatory efforts to find a balance and, ultimately, to ensure trust in both digital records and their storage in the cloud. Adding a particular challenge is the fact that distinct jurisdictions approach privacy differently and an in-depth understanding of what a jurisdiction's laws may be, or even under what jurisdiction particular data might be, requires a Herculean effort. And yet, in order to protect privacy and enhance security, this effort is required. This article examines two legal tools for ensuring the privacy and security of records in the cloud, data protection laws, and data localization laws, through the framework of “trust” as understood in archival science. This framework of trust provides new directions for algorithmic research, identifying those areas of digital record creation and preservation most in need of novel solutions.","","52:Numerical Analysis, Simulation, and Modeling (C,Archives {\&} records,Cloud computing,Computer security,Jurisdiction,Laws,Mathematics,Privacy","",""

The enhanced security is achieved by using two layers of authentication to facilitate a login process so that should one layer become compromised (e.g. a password), the second layer will still ensure that the account is protected. Considering the prevalence of cybercrime and in particular, password attacks, it is important to examine the behaviour of individuals in terms of the effort they make to protect their online account(s). Studies surrounding 2FA have focused on the various technologies supporting it as well as issues concerning its usability and convenience. In general, users fail to protect themselves online due to the effort that is required. Enhanced security means increased effort and inconvenience, and although risks are present and perceived by Internet users, sufficient effort to protect their online accounts is not made. This study made use of a Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) approach in trying to understand the behaviour of Internet users surrounding their intentions to adopt 2FA to protect their online account(s). The PMT model is adapted to include an additional concept focusing on 'Technology Awareness'. Empirical data was collected using an online survey, with 209 responses analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). Results were in line with other protective technology literature in terms of the perception of online threat vulnerability and severity being less significant in determining behavioural intention than the perception of the technology itself. The results show that the perception of (1) the difficulty associated with using the 2FA technology (response costs) and (2) the effectiveness of the 2FA technology (response efficacy) prove to be significant in determining behavioural intention to adopt 2FA as protective technology. Lastly, awareness of online security issues and solutions was relevant in the adapted PMT model and significantly influenced intention.","","Access control,Authentication,Behavior,Computer security,Computers,Computers--Computer Security,Crime,Empirical analysis,Information systems,Intelligence,Internet,Internet crime,Motivation,Network security,Passwords,Perception,Perceptions,Personal computers,Research,Technology adoption,Telephone banking,Usability","",""

In part 2, we develop the argument that it is inappropriate for infrastructure cloud providers, many of which are based outside Europe, to become subject arbitrarily to EU Data Protection Directive obligations due to their users' choices. EU data protection responsibilities are imposed primarily on controllers, who may engage processors. We suggest that end-to-end accountability should replace the binary controller/processor distinction, given today's environment of complex chains of actors. While cloud computing providers are commonly considered processors or controllers, we further argue that many providers are not even processors, but simply provide resources for use by others. Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and certain Software as a Service providers, who offer no more than utility infrastructure, will often not know whether information processed through their services is personal data - hence, the cloud of unknowing. They are qualitatively distinct from services like social networking websites. We suggest such providers should be considered mere neutral intermediaries. Existing liability defences for certain providers under the EU Electronic Commerce Directive, to help foster electronic commerce, cease upon the provider having knowledge and control. Similarly, our proposed intermediary immunity from data protection obligations would cease if the provider gains the requisite knowledge and/or requisite access to personal data. It may also behove cloud computing providers to develop appropriate industry standards/best practices to help provide a clear boundary between this intermediary status and processor (or even controller) status.","","2410:Social responsibility,4310:Regulation,45411:Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses,5140:Security management,5250:Telecommunications systems {\&} Internet communications,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9175:Western Europe,Cloud computing,Consumer protection,Data integrity,Electronic commerce,Europe,Infrastructure,Law,Professional liability,Right of privacy,Studies","",""

We model our access control scheme using ontological techniques and Web Ontology Language (OWL), and implement it via CLIPS rules. To evaluate the efficiency of our access control scheme, we measure the time it takes to check the access rights of the access requests. The results demonstrate that the highest response time is approximately 0.2 seconds in a set of 100000 triples.

The paper also presents some of the main changes affecting both natural persons and legal entities. Further, certain issues that might occur while implementing the Regulation are raised together with the degree of individuals' awareness of the need to protect the personal data stored on their mobile devices. Design/Methods/Approach: For the purpose of this paper, we reviewed the legislation, Slovenian and international literature, brochures and media stories in the field of personal data protection. We also used a questionnaire to determine the degree of awareness of the importance of protecting personal data among the general population. Findings: The findings show that no revolutionary changes are introduced. Nevertheless, quite a few novelties concern data controllers and processors. In particular, penalties for breaching the GDPR are now much higher. Individuals' rights are strengthened and easier to control. In contrast, data controllers and processors are subject to more stringent duties and legal obligations. These changes also apply to mobile device users. The research findings show that individuals are relatively well aware of the concept of personal data; however, the scope of their knowledge shrinks as this concept becomes increasingly complex. Familiarity with the new Regulation (2016/679) having been introduced at the EU level was claimed by 55{\%} of the respondents (N = 195). Research Limitations/Implications: The limitations stem from the selective choice of the GDPR's impact on mobile device users. More important influences are emphasised. Originality/Value: The findings will help both individuals and legal entities understand the changes brought to the area of data protection and tackle them more successfully.Alternate abstract:Namen prispevka: V pr{\'{i}}spevku smo predstavili klju{\v{c}}ni vpliv evropske uredbe (2016/679) o varstvu posameznikov pri obdelavi osebnih podatkov na uporabnike mobilnih naprav.

Medical app accreditation programs offer a mechanism for assuring the quality of apps; however, little is known about their ability to control information privacy risks. We aimed to assess the extent to which already-certified apps complied with data protection principles mandated by the largest national accreditation program.   Methods   Cross-sectional, systematic, 6-month assessment of 79 apps certified as clinically safe and trustworthy by the UK NHS Health Apps Library. Protocol-based testing was used to characterize personal information collection, local-device storage and information transmission. Observed information handling practices were compared against privacy policy commitments.   Results   The study revealed that 89 {\%} (n = 70/79) of apps transmitted information to online services. No app encrypted personal information stored locally. Furthermore, 66 {\%} (23/35) of apps sending identifying information over the Internet did not use encryption and 20 {\%} (7/35) did not have a privacy policy. Overall, 67 {\%} (53/79) of apps had some form of privacy policy. No app collected or transmitted information that a policy explicitly stated it would not; however, 78 {\%} (38/49) of information-transmitting apps with a policy did not describe the nature of personal information included in transmissions. Four apps sent both identifying and health information without encryption. Although the study was not designed to examine data handling after transmission to online services, security problems appeared to place users at risk of data theft in two cases.   Conclusions   Systematic gaps in compliance with data protection principles in accredited health apps question whether certification programs relying substantially on developer disclosures can provide a trusted resource for patients and clinicians. Accreditation programs should, as a minimum, provide consistent and reliable warnings about possible threats and, ideally, require publishers to rectify vulnerabilities before apps are released.","","Accreditation,Apps,Confidentiality,Cross-sectional study,Medical Sciences,Mobile,NHS,Privacy,Smartphone,Systematic assessment","",""

After identifying the benefits from various AI usages and the risks posed by AI-related technologies, I then analyze legal frameworks and relevant discussions in the EU, USA, Canada, and Japan, and further consider the efforts of Privacy by Design (“PbD”) originating in Ontario, Canada. While various AI usages provide great convenience, many issues, including profiling, discriminatory decisions, lack of transparency, and impeding consent, have emerged. The unpredictability arising from the AI machine learning function poses further difficulties, which have only been partially addressed by legal frameworks in the aforementioned jurisdictions. However, analyzing the relevant discussions yielded several suggestions. The first priority is adopting PbD as the most flexible, soft-legal, and preferable approach toward AI-oriented issues. Implementing PbD will protect individual privacy and personal data without specific efforts, and achieve both the development of AI and the advancement of privacy and personal data protection. Technical measures that can adapt to an individual's dynamic choices according to the “context” should be further developed. Furthermore, alternative technical measures, including those to solve the “algorithmic black box” or achieve differential privacy, warrant thorough examination.

In addition, the paper aims at establishing how they interfere with user privacy and determine the users' level of awareness. Design/Methods/Approach: For the purpose of this paper, existing literature was reviewed and analysed, and a questionnaire was distributed in a digital form. 229 respondents participated in the survey. Findings: It has been found that smart energy meters collect very accurate information about users' electricity consumption at short intervals. The information can then be used to identify devices, identify the presence or absence of people, their habits and activities. According to the survey results, the awareness among people using smart energy meters is low. Research Limitations/Implications: The limitations stem from the survey sample, as only people who are users of online social networks, e-mail and internet messaging applications (Viber, WhatsApp) were included in the survey. Practical Implications: The paper presents key findings in the field of smart energy meters and their potential for compromising individuals' safety and privacy. The paper discusses different ways in which energy consumption information can be exploited and used to harm users, as well as methods for establishing a secure and reliable network. Originality/Value: Due to the increasing share of smart energy meters installed in Slovenia, there is an increasing risk of privacy intrusions and threats to the safety of individuals. The research findings will help increasing users' awareness about smart energy meters and prevent potential abuse of their data.Alternate abstract:Namen prispevka: Namen prispevka je predstaviti klju{\v{c}}ne lastnosti pametnih merilnikov energije, njihove prednosti in slabosti ter ugotoviti, kako posegajo v uporabnikovo zasebnost in kak{\v{s}}no zavedanje o tem imajo ljudje.

These laws impose administrative and financial burdens on companies that manage personal information and may hinder the legitimate and valuable sharing and analysis of this information. In this paper we describe an integrated set of technologies, known as the Hippocratic Database (HDB), which enables compliance with security and privacy regulations without impeding the legitimate flow of information. HDB's Control Center allows companies to specify fine-grained disclosure policies based on the role of the user, the purpose of the access, the intended recipient, and other disclosure conditions. Its Active Enforcement component transparently enforces these policies by transforming user queries in a middleware layer to ensure that the database returns only policy-compliant information. HDB's Compliance Auditing system efficiently tracks all database accesses and allows auditors to formulate precise audit queries to monitor compliance with privacy and security policies. In this paper, we outline the basic architecture of the HDB solution, discuss the advantages of our approach, and illustrate the features of each component with practical compliance scenarios from the financial services industry.

As a step toward developing an indicator of risk that decomposes risk into several categories, or dimensions, we conducted two studies designed to assess the dimensions of risk deemed most important by experts and novices. In Study 1, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 security experts, who also performed a card sorting task in which they categorized permissions. The experts identified three major risk dimensions in the interviews (personal information privacy, monetary risk, and device availability/stability), and a forth dimension (data integrity) in the card sorting task. In Study 2, 350 typical Android users, recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk, filled out a questionnaire in which they (a) answered questions concerning their mobile device usage, (b) rated how often they considered each of several types of information when installing apps, (c) indicated what they considered to be the biggest risk associated with installing an app on their mobile device, and (d) rated their concerns with regard to specific risk types and about apps having access to specific types of information. In general, the typical users' concerns were similar to those of the security experts. The results of the studies suggest that risk information should be organized into several risk types that can be better understood by users and that a mid-level risk summary should incorporate the dimensions of personal information privacy, monetary risk, device availability/stability risk and data integrity risk.","","android, risk, smartphones,mobile security","",""

Every day, millions of data are loaded through various channels on the web by users and user input can be malicious. Therefore, security becomes a very important aspect of web applications. Since they are easily accessible, they are prone to many vulnerabilities which if neglected can cause harm. The attackers make use of these loopholes to gain unauthorized access by performing various illegal activities. SQL Injection is one such attack which is easy to perform but difficult to detect because of its varied types and channel. This may result in theft, leak of personal data or loss of property. In this paper we have analyzed the existing solutions to the problems such as AMNESIA [1] and SQLrand [3] and their limitations. We have devised a classifier for detection of SQL Injection attacks. The proposed classifier uses combination of Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes machine learning algorithm and Role Based Access Control mechanism for detection. The proposed model is tested based on the test cases derived from the three SQLIA attacks: comments, union and tautology.","","authorisation;Bayes methods;Internet;learning (art","",""

Although previous studies have investigated individuals' concerns about information privacy practices, the adverse consequences people associate with external actors accessing their personal information remain unclear. To mitigate customers' fears, organisations need to know which adverse consequences individuals are afraid of and how to address those negative perceptions. To investigate this topic, we conducted 22 focus groups with 119 participants. We developed a comprehensive conceptualisation and categorisation of individuals' perceived adverse consequences of access to their information that includes seven types of consequences: psychological, social, career-related, physical, resource-related, prosecution-related, and freedom-related. Although individuals may limit their interactions with an organisation owing to consequences they associate with both the organisation and other actors, organisations can apply preventive and corrective mechanisms to mitigate some of these negative perceptions. However, organisations' scope of influence is limited and some fears may be mitigated only by individuals themselves or government regulation, if at all.","","Computers--Computer Networks,Customer services,Data analysis,Perceptions,Personal information,access to individuals' information,focus group study,information privacy,mitigation mechanisms,perceived adverse consequences","",""

In this article, we explore consumer information privacy issues and review the results of related prior research. We provide a survey of the literature on information privacy based on our assessment from: (1) the societal and public policy perspective, (2) the business practices perspective, and (3) the individual privacy and consumer behavior perspectives that relate to the disclosure of private information by individuals to firms. From the societal and public policy perspective, we identify a number of research directions that relate to the social welfare implications of personal information surveillance, the safeguards needed at the societal level, and the nature of privacy-enhancing regulations. From the business practices perspective, we suggest other research directions that involve the examination of factors influencing organizational choices of privacy practices. We also offer some ways to discover how organizations can leverage their investments in information privacy. The individual and consumer behavior perspective, in turn, prompts Accounting Information Systems (AIS) researchers to look at the nature of people's beliefs and attitudes about privacy; the ways such attitudes affect their intentions and behaviors; and how individuals' behaviors can be influenced by organizational privacy policies and practices.

In today's era, it is most interesting and enticing technology which is offering the services to its users on demand over the Internet. Since cloud computing stores the data and its disseminated resources in the environment, security has become the main obstacle, which is hampering the deployment of cloud environments. There are number of users used cloud to store their personal data, so that data storage security is required on the storage media. The major concern of cloud environment is security during upload the data on cloud server. Data storage at cloud server attracted incredible amount of consideration or spotlight from different communities. For outsourcing the data there is a need of third party. The importance of third party is to prevent and control unauthorized access to data store to the cloud.

Some IoT applications are already on the market, such as in a smart home, wearable, connected vehicle, medical and healthcare, smart grids, and so on. However, the increasing use of IoT, especially in the individual domain, causes the opening of security vulnerabilities. Various studies have attempted to identify security issues on IoT. Many studies indicate that data privacy is one of the primary considerations in IoT because of the high possibility of creating security risks, such as unauthorized access, tapping, data modification, data forgery and so on. Some IoT services and applications provide personal and sensitive information openly and can be misused because of the leakage of data to third parties. Several studies state that the enforcement mechanism of IoT is still inadequate. Besides, there are issues such as identification problems, authentication and authorization, and cross-device dependencies. From the various vulnerabilities, threat sources have been identified by previous researchers apart from bad manufacturers and outside parties, namely IoT users themselves as owners of devices that intentionally or unintentionally provide access to sensitive information. From that case, user awareness becomes a critical aspect of the IoT ecosystem. Some countries are known to have prepared themselves with strategies and master plans in dealing with the IoT era. This study seeks to identify what efforts have been made by the government and other stakeholders in promoting IoT security for end-users in various countries and what best practices can be learned from existing initiatives, and what aspects might still need further research.","","Australia,Authentication,Computer privacy,Computers--Computer Security,End users,Internet of Things,Security management,Singapore,Smart buildings,Smart grid,Studies,United States--US","",""

Then, personal data are often saved on data servers of the storage providers such as Amazon, Google, Yahoo, Baidu and others. In this context, the secret sharing can be used to store personal data onto several providers, simultaneously reducing the risk of data loss, the data leakage to unauthorized parties, and data falsification. Secret sharing is one of the solutions to combine security and availability in the distributed storage. However, few works considered servers' affiliations, and specifically, the problem that a malicious provider may recover secret data illegally through manipulation on servers that hold enough shares to recover the secret. In this paper, to resolve the problem, we propose a two-threshold secret sharing scheme in order to enforce a new type of cross-group policy. By combining t-out-of-m providers' secret sharing scheme and a k-out-of-n servers' secret sharing scheme via an one-way function or an one-time pad, we construct a scheme that forces k shares to be collected from m groups. Compared with previous work, our scheme can attain the functionalities of proactively updating shares and adding new shares with simple computation.","","Cross-group Secret Sharing, Storage Service,Shamir Secret Sharing","",""

Including a data deletion principle in future data protection standards will increase respect for individual autonomy and decrease the risk of abuse of personal data.

Smart assistance systems can for example be found in cars. Connected to other internet of things devices, those assistants can help with the search for free parking lots in a crowded city or enable easy refueling in cooperation with intelligent charging stations. As the users' motivation to engage in those smart assistance systems is still undetected we investigate the influence of several potential drivers on the intention to use smart assistance systems in cars. This study uses survey data (N = 150) and structural equation modeling as the analysis method. Our results provide empirical evidence that convenience motives, performance expectancy, personal innovativeness, and perceived risk are drivers for consumers' intention to use smart assistance systems in cars. Moreover, we motivate further research in the field of smart assistance systems.

Users, however, often feel uncomfortable providing such information. In a privacy-minded design of recommenders, users are free to decide for themselves what data they want to disclose about themselves. But this decision is often complex and burdensome, because the consequences of disclosing personal information are uncertain or even unknown. Although a number of researchers have tried to analyze and facilitate such information disclosure decisions, their research results are fragmented, and they often do not hold up well across studies. This article describes a unified approach to privacy decision research that describes the cognitive processes involved in users' “privacy calculus” in terms of system-related perceptions and experiences that act as mediating factors to information disclosure. The approach is applied in an online experiment with 493 participants using a mock-up of a context-aware recommender system. Analyzing the results with a structural linear model, we demonstrate that personal privacy concerns and disclosure justification messages affect the perception of and experience with a system, which in turn drive information disclosure decisions. Overall, disclosure justification messages do not increase disclosure. Although they are perceived to be valuable, they decrease users' trust and satisfaction. Another result is that manipulating the order of the requests increases the disclosure of items requested early but decreases the disclosure of items requested later.","","Privacy, decision-making, information disclosure, recommender systems,user experience","",""

Despite the impressive scope of this phenomenon, very little is understood about what motivates users to disclose personal information. Integrating focus group results into a theoretical privacy calculus framework, we develop and empirically test a Structural Equation Model of self-disclosure with 259 subjects. We find that users are primarily motivated to disclose information because of the convenience of maintaining and developing relationships and platform enjoyment. Countervailing these benefits, privacy risks represent a critical barrier to information disclosure. However, users' perception of risk can be mitigated by their trust in the network provider and availability of control options. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for network providers.

Analysis of relevant cyber threats for such systems showed that the main threats are those aimed at disrupting the management processes of enterprises, urban infrastructure, and not at stealing personal data. As a result of a detailed review of existing risk assessment methods, it was found that traditional cyber-risk analysis strategies developed for static computer networks do not meet the requirements and cannot be directly applied in the construction and evaluation of heterogeneous, flexible, reconfigurable information systems based on dynamic networks. In this paper, the author proposes a neural network approach to assessing cybersecurity risks, based on a quantitative assessment and takes into account the use of a large number of devices and their constant interaction. A three-layer perceptron was chosen as a model of a neural network, datasets were generated synthetically using a network simulator NS-3. Experimental results showed that the neural network model proposed by the author allows for rapidly changing conditions to unambiguously and reasonably assess the risks of cybersecurity. The developed risk assessment method is comprehensive and adapted to various types of objects in large dynamic networks of a smart city.","","ANN, Cybersecurity, Large-Scale Network, Machine Learning, Neural Network, Perceptron, Risk Assessment, Smart City,Quantitative Risk","",""

This research is part of a project on posthumous medical data donation developed by the Digital Ethics Lab at the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford. Ten arguments are provided to support the need to foster posthumous medical data donation. Two major risks are also identified—harm to others, and lack of control over the use of data—which could follow from unregulated donation of medical data. The argument that record-based medical research should proceed without the need to secure informed consent is rejected, and instead a voluntary and participatory approach to using personal medical data should be followed. The analysis concludes by stressing the need to develop an ethical code for data donation to minimise the risks, and offers five foundational principles for ethical medical data donation suggested as a draft code.","","Bioethics,Data collection,Data donation,Data philanthropy,Donations,Ethical code,Ethics,Informed consent,Medical data ethics,Medical records,Medical research,Organs,Philosophy","",""

With data breaches now a common occurrence, it is becoming increasingly plain that while modern organizations need to put into place measures to try to prevent breaches, they must also put into place processes to deal with a breach once it occurs. Prior research on information technology security and services failures suggests that customer compensation can potentially restore customer sentiment after such data breaches. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, the authors draw on the literature on personality traits and social influence to better understand the antecedents of perceived compensation and the effectiveness of compensation strategies. The authors studied the propositions using data collected in the context of Target's large-scale data breach that occurred in December 2013 and affected the personal data of more than 70 million customers. In total, the authors collected data from 212 breached customers.FindingsThe results show that customers' personality traits and their social environment significantly influences their perceptions of compensation. The authors also found that perceived compensation positively influences service recovery and customer experience.Originality/valueThe results add to the emerging literature on Big Data Analytics and will help organizations to more effectively manage compensation strategies in large-scale data breaches.","","45221:Department Stores,Analytics,Big Data,Business And Economics--Management,Compensation,Computer security,Computer viruses,Credit cards,Customer satisfaction,Customer services,Customers,Data analysis,Data integrity,Data management,Discount department stores,Information technology,Marketing,Operations management,Organizations,Perceptions,Personality,Privacy,Production management,Service restoration,Social networks,United States--US","",""

In light of this catastrophe and the growing number of mass data breaches, many privacy advocates and U.S. consumers have begun to advocate for federal data protection legislation. However, companies that thrive off big data, such as Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Equifax, have spent millions lobbying against data protection laws. As a result, the United States has no universal, federal data protection law. Many states and specific sectors of the economy, such as healthcare and finance, have tried to bridge this gap in legislation with their own data protection laws. However, businesses continue to collect, store, and sell the personal information of consumers with few consumer protections. In comparison, the EU recently passed the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which guarantees EU citizens the fundamental right to data protection and forces companies to implement data protection regulations and baseline security measures when collecting personal information.

Thus, its guarantees were included in the high-level regulations of the European Union as well as the legal norms of the EU Member States. The first Polish law regulating the protection of personal data was adopted in 1997 as the implementation of EU Directive 95/46. The law imposed a number of obligations on public and private entities which process personal data in order to protect the rights of data subjects and, in particular, to guarantee them the ability to control the correctness of processing of their personal data. Therefore, the law obliged data controllers to process data only on the basis of the premises indicated in the legislation, to adequately secure data, and to comply with the disclosure obligation concerning data subjects, including their right to correct false or outdated data or to request removal of data processed in violation of the law. However, as complaints directed by citizens to the supervisory body?the Inspector General for Personal Data Protection?showed, personal data controllers, especially those operating in the private sector, did not comply with the law, acting in a manner that violated their customers? rights. In the hitherto existing unfair business practices of entrepreneurs, the violations of the data protection provisions that were the most burdensome for customers were related to preventing them from exercising their rights, including the right to control the processing of data, as well as the failure to provide the controller?s business address, which made it impossible for subjects whose data were used in violation of the law or for the inspecting authorities to contact the company, a lack of data security and a failure to follow the procedures required by law, the failure to secure documents containing personal data or their abandonment, a lack of updating customer data, the use of unverified data sets and sending marketing offers to deceased people or incorrect target recipients, and excessive amounts of data requested by controllers. The violations of the rights of data subjects recorded in Poland and other EU Member States-among other arguments-provided inspiration for the preparation of a new legal act in the form of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (which entered into force on 25 May 2018). The extension of the rights of people whose data are processed was combined in the GDPR with the introduction of new legal instruments disciplining data controllers. Instruments in the form of administrative fines and the strongly emphasised possibility to demand compensation for a violation of the right to data protection were directed in particular against economic entities violating the law.","","Business ethics,Consumer protection,Data integrity,Entrepreneurs,General Data Protection Regulation,Guarantees,Personal information,Poland,Right of privacy,Sociology","",""

Implementing proper measures towards security and privacy protection of smart systems, therefore, becomes of critical importance. In this paper we present a study to investigate beliefs among end users, whether the smart system providers are both capable and motivated to implement such measures. For this purpose, we conduct an online survey of 98 participants from the UK, which we analyse using quantitative and qualitative methods. Our results show that users' trust in proper security and privacy protection in smart systems is influenced by a multitude of factors such as information about concrete technologies and privacy policies of the systems, but also information about the company such as its reputation or geographical location. We conclude that transparency by companies, regarding both the technologies behind the concrete system and the general practices of the company itself, is a crucial factor in ensuring end user confidence.","","","",""

The European Union Data Directive (1995) endorses the opt-in approach, whereas the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) recommends an opt-out procedure for consumers to remove their data from future uses.

The datasets indicate a substantial rise in online fraud - though one that is lower than the rise in online shopping and other 'routine activity' indicators - but it is not obvious whether this is just displacement for the fall in household and automobile property crime, nor how much overlap there is between the offenders and past 'offline' offenders. Nor do the data indicate whether the frauds result from insiders or outsiders, or are collusive. The direct and indirect costs of cyberfrauds are examined, and it is concluded that there is no satisfactory basis for the larger estimates of cost, but it is undeniable that those costs are large enough to merit concern. There remains a problem of what metrics are appropriate for judging the threat and harm from cybercrimes, and their impact on national and human security. There is not a sharp division between these larger national security issues and cyber attacks on banks, businesses, and the spear phishing of individuals with important knowledge of system vulnerabilities in the public or the private sector.

This is a relationship which needs to be explored in-depth because of three concurrent trends -- first, the push towards e-government, where citizen-government transactions are increasingly conducted online; second, the growing use of smart cards, RFID tags and other portable information collection and transmission devices by governments and businesses; and third, calls for greater government surveillance, both online and offline, to counter terrorism in the post 9/11 environment.While prior research has dealt with individual concerns about online privacy and individual concerns about government surveillance, studies exploring the relationship between the two are limited. This study seeks to fill that gap by surveying Internet users across five cities which vary in their experience of government surveillance and the use of national ID cards -- Bangalore, New York, Seoul, Singapore and Sydney.Personal information privacy is the individual's ability to personally control information about him/herself. Such information could include anything from one's birth registration details, to the identities and coordinates of one's next-of-kin, income and expenditure patterns and even health records. In countries where day-to-day transactions with commercial and government entities are increasingly being conducted online, involving the electronic collection of personal information, online privacy is the principal manifestation of personal information privacy.As e-commerce and e-government services become more pervasive, Internet users' concerns about online privacy are likely to grow. Individual online privacy concerns have been classified into improper acquisition, improper use and privacy invasion.12 Concerns about improper acquisition relate to unauthorized access to personal information, improper collection of one's private information and improper monitoring of consumers' online activities. Concerns about improper use cover unauthorised analysis of consumers' online shopping behavior and the subsequent business-to-business transfer of such analyses. Concerns about privacy invasion refer to the transmission of information to Internet users without their prior consent, such as spam, as well as the improper storage of personal information. To maintain their online privacy, Internet users can engage in self-protective behaviour such as opting out, using privacy enhancing technologies, reading privacy policies, or checking trust marks.Studies have been conducted to test concern about online privacy as a function of demographic variables. Sheehan10 found that gender was a significant factor in that female consumers were generally more concerned about their personal privacy than male consumers. In general, older consumers2 were also more concerned about online privacy. The relationship between consumers' experience with the Internet and online privacy concerns has also been explored. Bellman et al.2 reported that consumers' online privacy concerns diminished with Internet experience. As more consumers use the Internet and the average level of experience rises, online privacy concerns should gradually diminish. In general, studies have demonstrated that demographic variables and Internet-related experiences significantly affect Internet users' concern about online privacy.","","","",""

The aim of the article is to analyse the principles and peculiarities of safe management of the personal data in social networks. In this scientific article, methods of document analysis, scientific literature review, case study and generalization are used. Consumers themselves decide how much and what kind of information to publicize on the Facebook social network. In order to use the third-party applications, users at the time of authorization must confirm that they agree to give access to their personal data otherwise the service will not be provided. Personal data of the Facebook user comprise his/her public profile including user's photo, age, gender, and other public information; a list of friends; e-mail mail; time zone records; birthday; photos; hobbies, etc. Which personal data will be requested from the user depends on the third-party application. Analysis of the legal protection of personal data in the internet social networks reveals that it is limited to the international and European Union legal regulation on protection of the personal data in the online social networks. Users who make publicly available a large amount of personal information on the Facebook social network should decide on the issue if they want to share that information with third parties for the use of their services (applications).

By algorithms we mean predictive models (decision rules) captured from historical data using data mining. Such models often decide prices we pay, select ads we see and news we read online, match job descriptions and candidate CVs, decide who gets a loan, who goes through an extra airport security check, or who gets released on parole. Yet growing evidence suggests that decision making by algorithms may discriminate people, even if the computing process is fair and well-intentioned. This happens due to biased or non-representative learning data in combination with inadvertent modeling procedures. From the regulatory perspective there are two tendencies in relation to this issue: (1) to ensure that data-driven decision making is not discriminatory, and (2) to restrict overall collecting and storing of private data to a necessary minimum. This paper shows that from the computing perspective these two goals are contradictory. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically with standard regression models that in order to make sure that decision models are non-discriminatory, for instance, with respect to race, the sensitive racial information needs to be used in the model building process. Of course, after the model is ready, race should not be required as an input variable for decision making. From the regulatory perspective this has an important implication: collecting sensitive personal data is necessary in order to guarantee fairness of algorithms, and law making needs to find sensible ways to allow using such data in the modeling process.","","14.13:COMPUTERS,2600:Management science/operations research,4320:Legislation,5200:Communications {\&} information management,9130:Experimental/theoretical,Airport security,Airports,Algorithms,Analysis,Computation,Computer information security,Computers--Artificial Intelligence,Data mining,Decision making,Fairness,Finland,Legislation,Modelling,Netherlands,Non-discrimination,Personal data,Personal information,Race,Regression,Regression models,Sensitive data,Studies","",""

Unfortunately, when we lend our phones to others, we give away complete access because existing phones assume a single user and provide little protection for private data and applications. In this work, we present xShare, a protection solution to address this problem. xShare allows phone owners to rapidly specify what they want to share and place the phone into a restricted mode where only the data and applications intended for sharing can be accessed.We first present findings from two motivational user studies based on which we provide the design requirements of xShare. We then present the design of xShare based on file-level access control. We describe the implementation of xShare on Windows Mobile and report a comprehensive usability evaluation of the implementation, including mea-surements and user studies. The evaluation demonstrates that our xShare implementation has negligible overhead for interactive phone usage, is extremely favored by mobile users, and provides robust protection against attacks by experienced Windows Mobile users and developers.","","privacy, sharing, virtualization,mobile phone","",""

By federal statute, consumer liability for unauthorized credit card charges is capped at a maximum of fifty dollars per account.38 Similarly, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act limits consumer liability for unauthorized debit card transactions, depending on how quickly the loss or theft of the card is reported.39 Some credit and debit card issuers even go so far as to adopt a policy to reimburse all fraudulent charges incurred on users' accounts.40 Consumers are then left with the relatively minor inconveniences of cancelling and reactivating cards, losing temporary access to account funds, and redirecting automatic payments and deposits.41 The unauthorized creation of new accounts, by contrast, may result in severe, long-term financial and other hardships.42 Depending on the type of data obtained, an identity can be used, among other things, to open bank or credit card accounts, file tax returns, originate home mortgages, or apply for government benefits.43 Because the unauthorized creation of new accounts generally requires the use of one or more forms of personally identifiable information44-typically including social security numbers-it is more difficult and labor intensive to achieve","","Computer security,Consumers,Credit cards,Data integrity,Fraud,Identity theft,Internet crime,Law,Law enforcement,Liability,Malware,United States--US","",""

The Brazilian legal framework still lacks an extensive and detailed regulation regarding the protection of personal data. On the other hand, the Brazilian regulatory agency for electric energy has issued a Normative Resolution on smart meters, which is, nevertheless, too general and leaves to interpretation important questions related to the legal treatment of energy data. While two Draft Bills on smart metering can be regarded as insufficient to address the matter highlighted in this paper, one Draft Bill on personal data's protection might fill the regulatory gap. Special attention should be drawn towards the relation between the data minimization principle and the efficiency of smart metering systems, since the efficiency of these technology depends on the amount of data collected and processed.

In this article, we report the findings of a project in which we used cultural probes to generate discussion about personal digital dataveillance. Our findings suggest the prevailing dominance of tacit assumptions about the uses and benefits of dataveillance as well as fears and anxieties about its possible misuse. Participants were able to identify a range of ways in which dataveillance is conducted, but were more aware of obvious commercial and some government actors. There was very little identification of the types of dataveillance that are used by national security and policing agencies or of illegal access by hackers and cybercriminals. We found that the participants recognised the value of both personal data and the big aggregated data sets that their own data may be part of, particularly for their own convenience.

In general, US laws governing research and disclosure and use of data generated within the health care system do not impose different requirements on transfers to researchers and service providers based in third countries compared with US-based researchers or service providers. Of note, the US lacks a comprehensive data protection regime. Data protections are piecemeal, spread across bodies of law that target specific kinds of research or data generated or held by specific kinds of actors involved in the delivery of health care. Oversight is also distributed across a range of bodies, including institutional review boards and data access committees. The conclusion to this paper examines future directions in US law and policy, including proposals for more comprehensive protections for personal data.","","Biology--Genetics,Researchers,United States--US","",""

Despite the importance of understanding the nature of online consumers' concerns for information privacy, this topic has received little attention in the information systems community. To fill the gap in the literature, this article focuses on three distinct, yet closely related, issues. First, drawing on social contract theory, we offer a theoretical framework on the dimensionality of Internet users' information privacy concerns (IUIPC). Second, we attempt to operationalize the multidimensional notion of IUIPC using a second-order construct, and we develop a scale for it. Third, we propose and test a causal model on the relationship between IUIPC and behavioral intention toward releasing personal information at the request of a marketer. We conducted two separate field surveys and collected data from 742 household respondents in one-on-one, face-to-face interviews. The results of this study indicate that the second-order IUIPC factor, which consists of three first-order dimensions - namely, collection, control, and awareness - exhibited desirable psychometric properties in the context of online privacy. In addition, we found that the causal model centering on IUIPC fits the data satisfactorily and explains a large amount of variance in behavioral intention, suggesting that the proposed model will serve as a useful tool for analyzing online consumers' reactions to various privacy threats on the Internet.

For numerous reasons, conventional personal (identification) information leaks from databases that store online and/or on-site user transaction data. Collected ID numbers and supporting personal information enable malicious parties to commit large-scale identity fraud. Gates and Slonim (NSPW 2003) proposed the owner-controlled information paradigm to address privacy violations of personal information where users are expected to maintain all their information using a personal device. Rubin and Wright (FC 2001), Molloy et al. (FC 2007), and others explored the use of one-time numbers to address credit card fraud (mostly for online use). However, several other types of ID number are at least as sensitive as credit card numbers. Our fundamental assumption is that collected personal information will eventually be breached. To combat identity fraud under this new environmental attack paradigm, we introduce a more general approach involving localized or customized ID numbers for both card-present and card-not-present transactions. We also explore four variants of the general idea to spark more discussion and further research in this area.","","data breaches, identity fraud, one-time use numbers, privacy,localization","",""

We discovered that students do not use their mobile devices just for private purposes but also for work related tasks; furthermore, they use their private mobile devices to access various information systems and corporate data that can be classified, or marked as trade secrets, personal data or professional secrecy. Individuals who are granted authorised access to these types of data are obliged to protect them from unauthorised access and cyber threats. In our survey, we tried to find out how well students were aware of the existing information security threats to mobile devices and to the data which they access through mobile devices. The results of our survey and criminal law analysis have shown us that the student population is not well aware of security threats and security measures. Because the user of a mobile device can be held criminally responsible for the loss of data that he or she had accessed by using the mobile device, even though he or she is not aware of security threats and protective measures against them, we believe that it will be necessary to encourage users to educate themselves about the new cyber threats that are typically targeting mobile devices, and also to familiarise themselves with the methods of protecting their mobile devices. To this purpose, organisations should implement internal regulations and continuously educate mobile device users about their safe usage in accordance with organisational standards.

Considering that the weakest point is the user, the most important aspect of log file processing is user activity analysis, building user profiles, identifying unusual events based on these and analyse them based on the data available about users for the organization.

By the end of the paper a cost-effective model is presented for automated user activity and profile analysis.","","5140:Security management,5220:Information technology management,9130:Experiment/theoretical treatment,Automation,Business And Economics,Corporate culture,Data integrity,Employees,Information systems,Process controls,Risk assessment,Studies","",""

In recent years, alongside these public health tools, commercial mobile apps such as Sickweather have also been released. Sickweather collects information from across the web, as well as self-reports from users, so that people can see who is sick in their neighborhood. The purpose of this paper is to examine the privacy and surveillance implications of digital disease tracking tools.Design/methodology/approachThe author performed a content and platform analysis of two apps, Sickweather and HealthMap, by using them for three months, taking regular screenshots and keeping a detailed user journal. This analysis was guided by the walkthrough method and a cultural-historical activity theory framework, taking note of imagery and other content, but also the app functionalities, including characteristics of membership, “rules” and parameters of community mobilization and engagement, monetization and moderation. This allowed me to study HealthMap and Sickweather as modes of governance that allow for (and depend upon) certain actions and particular activity systems.FindingsDraw on concepts of network power, the surveillance assemblage, and Deleuze's control societies, as well as the data gathered from the content and platform analysis, the author argues that disease tracking apps construct disease threat as omnipresent and urgent, compelling users to submit personal information – including sensitive health data – with little oversight or regulation.Originality/valueDisease tracking mobile apps are growing in popularity yet have received little attention, particularly regarding privacy concerns or the construction of disease risk.","","Analytics,Applications programs,Big Data,Community relations,Computers--Internet,Crowdsourcing,Data,Data mining,Disease tracking,Epidemics,Imagery,Infectious diseases,Mobile apps,Mobile computing,Privacy,Public health,Social networks,Surveillance,Surveillance medicine,Tools,Tracking,User generated content,Web sites","",""

Society's prevalent use of interconnected devices enables companies to collect and manipulate users' personal data for their own monetary benefits. While the law grapples with how best to protect users from such privacy risks, another significant danger has emerged: by besting the often-weak security measures employed by companies that create interconnected devices, hackers can compromise the integrity of these electronics by remotely accessing them. This allows hackers to gain unauthorized access to the personal data of users and potentially hold their devices for ransom. Smart devices are constantly evolving, and the risk that their users' personal information will be misused is increasing. However, Ontario law has been slow to acknowledge the possibility for individuals to obtain damages for breaches of their privacy. To date, Ontario courts have only recognized two invasion of privacy torts: the Intrusion Upon Seclusion and the Public Disclosure of Private Facts, both of which are very limited in scope. The aim of this paper is to examine whether these torts are sufficiently broad to address the privacy breaches that have become commonplace in our digital world. After outlining the privacy violations to which users of the Internet of Things are exposed, this paper will examine the potential of applying the Intrusion and Public Disclosure torts to such practices in an attempt to determine if users might be successful in obtaining monetary redress for such violations in a manner that the privacy legislation has been unable to achieve. This paper will then analyze whether or not these same torts might be used to impose liability on the companies responsible for personal information or devices that were breached by hackers. Finally, suggestions for how Ontario privacy law should evolve to better address our technologically enhanced reality will be explored.","","","",""

The IoT has improved the healthcare service delivery, thus allowing remote patient monitoring, early diagnosis, reduction of medical errors and effective decision making through the data generated by these IoT devices on a real-time basis. Although the IoT has shown a positive transformation in the healthcare sector, a number of challenges are presented, given that the health data is sensitive and its privacy should be preserved. The healthcare sector has become a target of attacks because of the amount of sensitive and personal data that is being collected and shared by these IoT devices. As a result, the healthcare sector has been experiencing major data breaches. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the root cause of data breaches in the healthcare sector. Secondly, investigate the limitations of the IoT devices in detecting data breaches. Thirdly, investigate the limitation of the security and privacy methods that are used in the healthcare sector to secure the healthcare data and preserve its privacy.

The conceptual model includes four variables: security concerns, perceived risk of cyberattacks, perceived government cybersecurity preparedness and e-services avoidance. Data from 774 participants were used to analyze our conceptual model.FindingsFirst, the findings show that security concerns regarding personal information safety and perceived risk of cyberattacks are barriers to e-services use, with the former having a stronger effect. Second, the findings showed that perceived government cybersecurity preparedness significantly reduces security concerns and perceived risk of cyberattacks. Third, the post hoc group analysis between individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher versus those without a bachelor's degree showed that the effect of both security concerns and perceived risk of cyberattacks on e-services avoidance was greater for individuals without a bachelor's degree.

The third category includes smartphone malware studies that examine the security aspects of smartphones and the threats posed by malware. The fourth category includes ranking, clustering and classification studies that classify malware based on their families or security risk levels. Several smartphone security apps have also been analysed and compared based on their mechanisms to identify their contents and distinguishing features by using several evaluation metrics and parameters. Two malware detection techniques, namely, machine-learning-based and non-machine-learning-based malware detection, are drawn from the review.

The current government 's agenda of making Digital Bangladesh attempts to ensure internet connection in all governmental institutions by 2021. Similarly, both national and multinational companies are now offering online services to consumers that facilitate online shopping, banking, and communication. However, criminals take their way in the digitalized world. They commit criminal activities through phishing, hacking and stealing of personal data. Thus governmental institutions and companies become under security threat for their secret data that can hamper the daily life of the entire population in the country. Moreover, the country's 90 percent of the software is pirated that exacerbates the cyber security in the country. In addition, recent clash between Bangladeshi and Indian hackers influence the diplomatic relations between the two countries. More importantly, terrorist organizations conduct their financial and information transactions through using internet. In this circumstance, the existing acts and initiatives against cyber crime are very limited to combat the threat.

Our study revealed a shift in policy over time from a rigid to a more collaborative approach to regulation. From the 1980s to the 2000s, security control measures were developed to prevent leakage of personal data to external entities, using methods such as anonymisation, which can be applied in a linkable or unlinkable fashion. However, by the 2010s, de-identification measures have been introduced. They make it possible to utilise personal data that is de-identified (not completely, but specific individuals cannot be easily identified) in certain types of genomic research. This also involved the establishment of an independent data protection authority that controls the utilisation of data in collaboration with other stakeholders. Through this process, bioethics policy has become an established science and technology policy in Japan; and in recent years, bioethics policy has also gained relevance in areas outside the life sciences.","","Bioethics,Bioethics policy,Biology--Biotechnology,Collaboration,Genomes,Human genome research,Japan,Life sciences,Personal data,Science and technology policy","",""

As the collection and mining of user data improves, both qualitatively and quantitatively, users' privacy is more and more at risk. Current OSNs and other web services are, at least logically, centralized and thus more vulnerable to accidental or deliberate privacy leaks as well as inference. Decentralization, taking away the control of a single service provider, can be a step toward preserving the users' privacy and giving them control over their own data. Even after removing the threats from centralized big data, the users' personal data needs to be protected from unauthorized access. In contrast to other proposals for decentralized OSNs, we aim to provide the basis for a privacy-preserving system built from light-weight and readily available components, namely the Extensible Access Control Mark up Language (XACML) and the Security Assertion Mark up Language (SAML) with secret key authentication, including simple ways of formulating access policies for users. We find that this combination provides a straightforward way of keeping and deliberately sharing personal information with other users that is robust against a range of attacks including unauthorized access at least in the case of every user's profile being stored on machines under their control. One can consider replicas on trusted servers, storage on untrusted servers, however, is left for future work.","","authorisation;Big Data;data analysis;data privacy;","",""

The Irish Data Protection Act 1988 and Amendment 2003 bring this responsibility into a legal forum. The aim of this audit is to assess how comprehensively medical tutors/consultants instilled knowledge and appreciation of confidentiality and data protection to medical students in a prominent Dublin University Hospital. Design/methodology/approach - Breaches in data protection legislation by final year medical students were identified by means of a questionnaire. Changes were made to the curriculum (presentations, notices on students' e-learning interface and induction manual) and to the exams in psychiatry, to increase awareness of data protection legislation. Students at the same point in their education were re-assessed one year later to see if the interventions were helpful in increasing knowledge and improving adherence to data protection legislation. Findings - Significant breaches of the data protection legislation at baseline and follow up were identified. Examples include: "Data shall be kept for one or more specified, explicit and legitimate purposes" - when asked if they would inform patients that assessments were for submission of a case report, 44 per cent at baseline and 56 per cent at follow-up said yes. "Appropriate security measures shall be taken against unauthorised access" - 52 per cent password-protected their computer at baseline and 59 per cent did at follow-up. Of those that had no password protection at baseline, 70 per cent of their computers were used by others, with little change in this at follow-up (68 per cent). At baseline 52 per cent kept a copy of reports on USB devices compared to 46 per cent at follow-up. 26 per cent admitted to losing a USB device in the past. "Data should not be kept longer than is necessary for that purpose" - 63 per cent admitting keeping electronic copies of case reports on their computers following submission at baseline and 64 per cent at follow-up. "Data should be made anonymous" - 96 per cent at baseline and 100 per cent at follow-up used initials when submitting case reports to make the data anonymous. Practical implications - What was disappointing was that, while knowledge and awareness of obligations under data protection legislation improved following intervention, breaches in compliance still remained. Originality/value - This is the first such audit in Ireland on the provision of educational training in the area of data protection legislation to medical students. It is likely that that such breaches by medical students reflect the tip of the iceberg in relation to probable breaches amongst registered healthcare professionals. The challenge now facing the medical profession and healthcare services is to effect behavioural change to improve compliance with data protection legislation.","","8320:Health care industry,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9175:Western Europe,Business And Economics--Management,College students,Compliance,Consent,Disclosure,Dublin Ireland,Personal health,Physicians,Privacy,Responsibilities,Right of privacy,Students","",""

This has led to more awareness of users in terms of protecting personal data. Within the IoT, there is a growing number of peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, increasing the exposure to security vulnerabilities, and the risk of cyberattacks. Blockchain technology has been explored as middleware in P2P transactions, but existing solutions have mainly focused on providing a safe environment for data trade without considering potential changes in interaction topologies. we present EdgeBoT, a proof-of-concept smart contracts based platform for the IoT built on top of the ethereum blockchain. With the Blockchain of Things (BoT) at the edge of the network, EdgeBoT enables a wider variety of interaction topologies between nodes in the network and external services while guaranteeing ownership of data and end users' privacy. in EdgeBoT, edge devices trade their data directly with third parties and without the need of intermediaries. This opens the door to new interaction modalities, in which data producers at the edge grant access to batches of their data to different third parties. Leveraging the immutability properties of blockchains, together with the distributed nature of smart contracts, data owners can audit and are aware of all transactions that have occurred with their data. we report initial results demonstrating the potential of EdgeBoT within the IoT. we show that integrating our solutions on top of existing IoT systems has a relatively small footprint in terms of computational resource usage, but a significant impact on the protection of data ownership and management of data trade.","","Blockchain,Chemistry--Analytical Chemistry,Consumers,Contracts,Cryptography,Data integrity,Data processing,Edge computing,Electronic devices,End users,Internet of Things,IoT,Middleware,Network topologies,Ownership,Privacy,Reputation management,Third party,blockchain,data ownership,data trade,edge computing,information security","",""

Studies show that individuals are concerned about database privacy; yet, they seldom make privacy a salient attribute when deciding among competing alternatives. Although privacy policies are present on many Web sites, Web users rarely bother to read them. Professor Nehf explores why this is so, identifying rational reasons why Web users do not shop for privacy and discussing the implications for the expanding market for consumer information. Unless privacy becomes a salient attribute influencing consumer choice, Web site operators will continue to obtain and use more personal information than Web users would choose to provide in a more transparent exchange. In a responding commentary, Professors Pitt and Watson use an ecosystem approach that explores the multiple dimensions of privacy. Investigating the interactions between the three major players-citizen/consumer/investor, government, and corporation-they identify reasons for the failure of market mechanisms to arise to protect privacy.

The initial goal of our research was to present a comprehensive database of data breaches of personal information that took place in 2018 and 2019. This information was to be drawn from press reports, industry studies, and reports from regulatory agencies across the world. This article identified the top 430 largest data breach incidents among more than 10,000 data breach incidents.In the process, we encountered many complications, especially regarding the lack of standardization of reporting. This article should be especially interesting to the readers of JDIQ because it describes both the range of data quality and consistency issues found as well as what was learned from the database created.The database that was created, available at https://www.databreachdb.com, shows that the number of data records breached in those top 430 incidents increased from around 4B in 2018 to more than 22B in 2019. This increase occurred despite the strong efforts from regulatory agencies across the world to enforce strict rules on data protection and privacy, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect in Europe in May 2018. Such regulatory effort could explain the reason why there is such a large number of data breach cases reported in the European Union when compared to the U.S. (more than 10,000 data breaches publicly reported in the U.S. since 2018, while the EU reported more than 160,0001 data breaches since May 2018). However, we still face the problem of an excessive number of breach incidents around the world.This research helps to understand the challenges of proper visibility of such incidents on a global scale.

[...]they likely cannot sue under state law as state and federal governments enjoy sovereign immunity.21 The government is shielded from liability, unless and until state or federal legislatures abrogate that immunity for state privacy claims.22 Fortunately for these individuals, however, this immunity does not protect the government from all claims.23 An individual whose information has been improperly acquired or disseminated by a governmental actor may still look to two sources for agency liability: the Federal Privacy Act24 or the Constitution.25 Due to the shortcomings of the Privacy Act and the Supreme Court's "restriction] on the ability of individuals to recover damages for a violation of the Act,"26 this Article primarily focuses on the constitutional right to informational privacy.27 While the Constitution does not explicitly provide a right to privacy,28 a number of Supreme Court decisions have recognized that the right may exist.29 In an attempt to clarify its scope, the Court in Whalen v. Roe declared that there are two types of privacy interests: "security of personal information and autonomy in making important decisions.  "182 A study conducted by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology quantified this concern and found that in 2013, 75{\%} of individuals surveyed were very or somewhat concerned with the privacy of their medical information.183 Roughly 8{\%} admitted to having withheld information from their healthcare providers due to their concerns with the privacy of their medical information.184 These numbers reflect concerns with the privacy of information stored in electronic medical records, an arena strictly regulated with little confusion as to what is or is not protected from disclosure.  [...]it takes no stretch of the imagination to predict even higher numbers should individuals be made more aware of state agents' ability in certain jurisdictions to improperly acquire or disclose information with no liability.  "191 Not only must a plaintiff prove the disclosure was willful, but she also must have suffered actual damage for which she can be compensated such as physical injury or a job termination.  [...]plaintiffs who have fallen victim to inadvertent breaches or those who suffered only "torment, anxiety, and . . . emotional stress wondering if and when this information will be used against them" are effectively left with the Constitution as their only option for recourse.192 Thus, Congress should amend the Privacy Act to explicitly include damages for mental or emotional distress.  While this solution would not necessarily provide recourse for those filing suit for an inadvertent disclosure of medical information, it would provide an alternative remedy for individuals in the Second and Sixth Circuits whose medical information has been intentionally disseminated by the government, even if their information did not rise to a constitutionally protected dimension.  [...]there is consistency among the circuit courts as to what medical information is constitutionally protected, permitting recovery for emotional distress under the Privacy Act would at least level the playing field for those afforded little ability to sue under the Constitution.","","Constitutional law,Data integrity,Federal court decisions,Georgia,Health Insurance Portability {\&} Accountability Act,Medical Sciences,Medical records,Patients,Personal health,Public health,Right of privacy,Social networks,Tax returns,Trends,United States--US","",""

There is the risk of unauthorized access, fraud and inappropriate disclosure of sensitive data. Human resources and malicious applications steal user identity, potentially resulting in a direct loss of highly sensitive information and hard currency to affected victims. To protect sensitive information, commercial and corporate sites extensively employ the use of textual passwords, which when used over an encrypted connection is vulnerable to attacks. To counter some of these attacks, many corporate sites instruct users to make use of mnemonic passwords without carefully considering the implications. This paper describes an empirical investigation performed to determine the factors influencing users mnemonic passwords practices, to analyze the strength of regular passwords and to evaluate the effectiveness of mnemonic passwords. Findings revealed that users' context, which allows the deployment of mnemonic strategies for password memorization, is prosaic in nature and susceptible to human attackers and automated tools. Commercial and corporate sites will need these findings in order to adopt effective authentication strategies for logging customers into their sites.

Because of this, developers of mobile operating systems have built in configuration options to these operating systems to better protect the device from security vulnerabilities. However, not all of these operating systems have such settings turned on when the device is pulled out of the box. Furthermore, not all users are aware of how to best protect their information, nor the kind of issues that should be considered when owning and using these devices.

Although the enterprise manages the environment in which work-related activities are conducted, referred to as a work persona, third-party applications installed on the mobile devices may make the enterprise content vulnerable to misuse or exfiltration. It is thus critical that enterprises be given the ability to restrict the capabilities of third-party applications that reside in the work persona. In mobile systems, applications typically request to use a list of capabilities on the device prior to being installed on the device, and alll capabilities must be granted in order for the applications to be installed. Our approach, that we refer to as DroidARM, focuses on post-installation application restriction policies. Such policies dynamically restrict the capabilities of mobile applications at run-time. An application restriction policy is configured through our Application Restriction Manager (ARM) Policy Manager that allows one to set different restrictions for each installed application. Adhering to the policy, our ARM system limits the capabilities of an application by restricting access to data and system resources contained within the work persona. Data shadowing is a data and system resource protection technique we have chosen to leverage. We have implemented DroidARM and integrated it into the Android operating system. Our experimental results show that our approach is efficient and effective.","","access control, android, byod, emm,containerization","",""

People are often the weakest link in an otherwise secure computer system and, consequently, are targeted for social engineering attacks. Social Engineering is a technique used by hackers or other attackers to gain access to information technology systems by getting the needed information (for example, a username and password) from a person rather than breaking into the system through electronic or algorithmic hacking methods. Such attacks can occur on both a physical and psychological level. The physical setting for these attacks occurs where a victim feels secure: often the workplace, the phone, the trash, and even on-line. Psychology is often used to create a rushed or officious ambiance that helps the social engineer to cajole information about accessing the system from an employee.Data privacy legislation in the United States and international countries that imposes privacy standards and fines for negligent or willful non-compliance increases the urgency to measure the trustworthiness of people and systems. One metric for determining compliance is to simulate, by audit, a social engineering attack upon an organization required to follow data privacy standards. Such an organization commits to protect the confidentiality of personal data with which it is entrusted.This paper presents the results of an approved social engineering audit made without notice within an organization where data security is a concern. Areas emphasized include experiences between the Social Engineer and the audited users, techniques used by the Social Engineer, and other findings from the audit. Possible steps to mitigate exposure to the dangers of Social Engineering through improved user education are reviewed.","","access control, physical security, user education,social engineering","",""

This notwithstanding, contextual services are rapidly proliferating into most niches of society, catalysed by technological advancements in sensing, ubiquity and mobile computing.

Consequently, contextual applications have propagated into personal, community, government and corporate services. Unfortunately, these services are seldom developed with onset personal information leak concerns. As a result, personal information pieces often leak in their handling, eroding the users' privacy. Privacy erosion is attributed to information leaks through covert acquisitions and re-purposing of legitimate data. Privacy loss from such erosion exposes individuals to significant harm often intractable or costly. This study identifies and sensitises information handling vulnerabilities on their privacy implications in context-aware services. We assert the need for stakeholders in contextual services to deliberate privacy implications of context throughout its life cycle as opposed to, detached focus at collection, transmission or usage points.

Rapid development of ubiquitous computing and 'the internet of things' are leading to Big Data and the application of Predictive Analytics, effectively merging the real world with cyberspace. The power of information technology is increasingly used to provide personalised services to citizens, leading to the availability of huge amounts of sensitive data about individuals, with potential and actual privacy-eroding effects. To protect the private sphere, deemed essential in a state of law, information and communication systems (ICTs) should meet the requirements laid down in numerous privacy regulations. Sensitive personal information may be captured by organizations, provided that the person providing the information consents to the information being gathered, and may only be used for the express purpose the information was gathered for. Any other use of information about persons without their consent is prohibited by law; notwithstanding legal exceptions. If regulations are properly translated into written code, they will be part of the outcomes of an ICT, and that ICT will therefore be privacy compliant. We conclude that privacy compliance in the 'technological' sense cannot meet citizens' concerns completely, and should therefore be augmented by a conceptual model to make privacy impact assessments at the level of citizens' lives possible.","","5200:Communications {\&} information management,9130:Experiment/theoretical treatment,Big Data,Business And Economics,Data analysis,Information management,Internet access,Privacy,Studies,Value chain","",""

The correlation between large-scale data breaches and increased regulation is not surprising.

Such a framing of incidents foregrounds the (problematic) access claims of "hackers" and the protection against those as the key issue in security. However, other access claims play a role in the same incidents, such as those of the data owners, service providers, advertising companies, intelligence agencies, etc. These access claims are made via different means, and they are backgrounded when the problem is framed in terms of unauthorised access through hacks. In this contribution, I investigate the activity of claiming access as a key analytical concept in a more symmetrical treatment of cybersecurity and associated incidents. Rather than implicit, normalised, and technologically congealed notions of threats and associated access claims, this analytical framework aims at highlighting all access claims within the scope of a cybersecurity phenomenon, in order to uncover the politics behind cybersecurity and associated discourses and infrastructures, and thereby increase transparency. By covering different types of resources and different means of access, the approach also has the potential to connect the rather separated discourses on cybersecurity, privacy, and social manipulation through technology.","","","",""

An asset is a persistent item or property of value and has an owner. Attacks damage assets; security controls prevent attacks to preserve their value. Expected attack loss is calculated from the value of the attacked assets. This common analytic approach works satisfyingly if an IT system runs in an enclosed environment within an organization. Nowadays, IT systems are accessed and used across organizational boundaries by a multitude of independent stakeholders employing them for their own interests and with particular expectations regarding their trustworthiness. The asset paradigm cannot support estimating consequences of security incidents that may harm these complex stakeholder collaborations. We propose to model the stakeholder collaboration networks and to analyze scenarios of how security incidents affect relationships between stakeholders. Collaboration continuously creates value for all participants. Security incidents change the behavior of stakeholders and their willingness to collaborate, but in complicated ways. Transmission factors characterizing a relationship help us to assess the impact of incidents. We apply the conventional method and our new approach to a case study and compare the results.","","assets, collaboration networks, harm analysis, requirements elicitation, risk assessment, threat modeling,security engineering","",""

We have many options in terms choosing web based cloud storage services for backing and archiving our data.

Backing up files so that they are not lost is an allimportant step to ensure that nothing is ever lost. But, moving to the cloud is itself a big change and there are real concerns that make people pause before they sign up for any such service. This paper proposes and implements an algorithm which would encrypt the files uploaded on such web based cloud storage services and would decrypt the file once it has been downloaded using the keys that were generated during encryption. This would prevent unwanted intrusion into personal data and lack of standardization, i.e. one service provider may have endtoend encryption while others do not.","","Accessibility,Archiving,Cloud Computing,Cloud Storage,Cloud computing,Computer security,Computer service industry,Computers,Cryptography,Data storage,Decryption,Electronic commerce,Encryption,Integrated works software,Intrusion,Service introduction,Standardization,Storage area networks","",""

Unfortunately, taking advantage of their benefits requires businesses to accept a number of serious risks to data security. Factors such as software bugs, operator errors and external attacks can all compromise the confidentiality of sensitive application data on external clouds, by making them vulnerable to unauthorized access by malicious parties.In this paper, we study and seek to improve the confidentiality of application data stored on third-party computing clouds. We propose to identify and encrypt all functionally encryptable data, sensitive data that can be encrypted without limiting the functionality of the application on the cloud. Such data would be stored on the cloud only in an encrypted form, accessible only to users with the correct keys, thus protecting its confidentiality against unintentional errors and attacks alike. We describe Silverline, a set of tools that automatically 1) identify all functionally encryptable data in a cloud application, 2) assign encryption keys to specific data subsets to minimize key management complexity while ensuring robustness to key compromise, and 3) provide transparent data access at the user device while preventing key compromise even from malicious clouds. Through experiments with real applications, we find that many web applications are dominated by storage and data sharing components that do not require interpreting raw data.

In this paper, we explore to what extent privacy concerns could be a barrier to social media adoption in this demographic. By analyzing in-depth interviews with 40 older adult users and non-users of social media living in East York1, Toronto, Canada, we explore the types of social media privacy concerns that older adults have as well as the strategies they employ to mitigate these concerns. We found that older adult social media users and non-users shared similar privacy concerns; the most often mentioned being a concern for unauthorized access to personal information, and information misuse. While older adult non-users of social media protected themselves by avoiding social media, older adults who were social media users protected themselves by limiting the information they shared. This study has policy implications for training programs geared toward older adults and informs understandings of privacy literacy across the lifespan.","","Facebook, Older adults, Twitter, social media, social media privacy concerns, social networking sites,privacy protection strategies","",""

The implementation of security policies in an SoC design, often referred to as its security architecture, is a subtle composition of coordinating design modules distributed across the different IPs. Toward this direction, this paper gives an overview of SoC security architectures in modern SoC designs and provides a glimpse of their implementation, as well as their design complexities and functional shortcomings. Design of security architectures involves a complex interplay of requirements from functionality, power, security, and validation.

At the heart of the issue was Cambridge Analytica (CA) which in partnership with Cambridge researcher, Aleksandr Kogan harvested data from millions of Facebook profiles. Kogan had developed an application called "thisisyourdigitallife " which featured a personality quiz and CA paid for people to take it. The app recorded results of each quiz, collected data from quiz taker's Facebook account such as personal information and Facebook activity (e.g., what content was "liked") as well as their Facebook friends which led to data harvesting of about 87 million Facebook profiles. The researcher then passed on this data to CA, which then used an algorithm that enabled them to psychologically profile people based on their Facebook interactions. Donald Trump had hired CA as a part of his 2016 Presidential election strategy. In order to deliver pro-Trump materials to individuals online, CA targeted individuals with a lesser known Facebook feature called "dark post" that contains personalized ads that are visible only to targeted individuals.CA consciously exploited fears of individuals with targeted advertising based on their personality profiles. The use of highly personalized ads made them vulnerable to Trump's messages that compelled them to vote for him. This digital onslaught played a significant role in Trump's victory over Hilary Clinton.

In light of the shortcomings of the government, industry and consumers in protecting anonymity, it is clear that a new perspective for ensuring anonymity is needed. Where current stakeholders have failed to protect anonymity, some proponents argue that economic models exist for valuation of anonymity. By placing a monetary value on anonymity through Rawls' concept of primary goods, it is possible to create a marketplace for anonymity, therefore allowing users full control of how their personal data is used. This paper aims to explore the creation of a data marketplace, offering users the possibility of engaging with companies and other entities to sell and auction personal data. Importantly, participation in a marketplace does not sacrifice one's anonymity, as there are different levels of anonymity in online systems.Design/methodology/approachThe paper uses a conceptual framework based on the abstractions of anonymity and data valuation.FindingsThe manuscript constructs a conceptual foundation for exploring the development and deployment of a personal data marketplace. By suggesting features allowing individuals' control of their personal data, and properly establishing monetary valuation of one's personal data, it is argued that individuals will undertake a more proactive management of personal data.Originality/valueAn overview of the available services and products offering increased anonymity is explored, in turn, illustrating the beginnings of a market response for anonymity as a valuable good. By placing a monetary value on individuals' anonymity, it is reasoned that individuals will more consciously protect their anonymity in ways where legislation and other practices (i.e. privacy policies, marketing opt-out) have failed.","","Anonymity,Auctions,Communications,Companies,Consumers,Economic analysis,Economic models,Foundation construction,Interest groups,Internet,Legislation,Marketing,On-line systems,Participation,Personal information,Privacy,Social networks,Stakeholders,Studies,United States--US,Valuation,Valuation methods,Value,Viability","",""

However, there is currently little awareness of public views about such research. The authors sought to explore attitudes of the public, and their lay representatives, towards the use of primary care medical record data for research when patient consent was not being sought.   Methods:  49 members of the public and four non-medical members of local community health councils in South Wales, UK gave their views on the value and acceptability of three current research scenarios, each describing access to data without patient consent.   Results:  Among focus group participants, awareness of research in primary care was low, and the appropriateness of general practitioners as researchers was questioned. There was general support for research but also concerns expressed about data collection without consent. These included lack of respect and patient control over the process. Unauthorised access to data by external agencies was a common fear. Current data collection practices, including population based disease registers elicited much anxiety. The key informants were equally critical of the scenarios and generally less accepting.   Conclusions:  This exploratory study has highlighted a number of areas of public concern when medical records are accessed for research without patient consent. Public acceptability regarding the use of medical records in research cannot simply be assumed. Further work is required to determine how widespread such views are and to inform those advising on confidentiality issues.","","Attitudes,Community,Confidentiality,Consent,Councils,Focus groups,General practice / family medicine,Interviews,Legal and forensic medicine,Medical Sciences,Medical research,Meetings,Public health,Researchers,Studies,United Kingdom--UK,confidentiality,data protection,informed consent,medical records,public opinion","",""

The European Union Directive legislation has aggressively set the pattern of excellence in preserving individual data privacy worldwide, and Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act exerts an influence on U.S. commerce Within the U.S. laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act seek to protect information privacy in specific industries.","","European union directive, Gramm-Leach-Bliley, IT education, data privacy, database design, legal issues, legislation,HIPAA","",""

Teachers and students in these universities store important data on the university's network including personal information, research data, student assignments, and test results. Thus, the importance of Network security in universities can be well understood. Network administrators of universities should be aware of various threats to their networks since their networks are connected to the internet which is the main source for incoming viruses and other threats for data on the network.

This question is actual for the healthcare industry. This is confirmed by the presence of large-scale measures that are being implemented as part of the Russian Federation's healthcare modernization program. But the result of informatization is not always achieved easily and successfully. This process includes the equipment of the technical support of the organization and the fragmentary implementation of information systems to the full informatization of medical institutions with the introduction of full-featured medical information systems. Informatization of healthcare organizations makes it possible to systematize a large amount of information. In turn, this requires the implementation of personal data protection systems, storage, archiving and access to this data. The introduction of these systems into the healthcare industry of the Russian Federation has recently entered a new stage. It has complex tasks to integrate new technologies that provide information security to medicine. So, the most pressing problem of the medical industry is information protection, that is, the creation of an ISMS (information security management system).","","Archiving,Health care,Health care facilities,Health care industry,Information management,Information systems,Modernization,New technology,Protection systems,Russia,Sciences: Comprehensive Works,Security,Security management,Security systems,Task complexity,Technical services","",""

As a result, the laissez-faire perspective on regulating the internet and data collection has fallen to the wayside as efforts to protect consumer data through regulation gain international traction. Leading in the charge to protect consumers' personal information is the European Union with its passage of the General Data Protection Regulation, which went into full force May 2018. Following suit, and central to this Comment, is California's recent passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Generally, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request that businesses disclose to the consumer what personal information is being collected or sold by the business. Subject to some limitations, consumers may also request the business refrain from selling their personal data or delete their personal information. The Act further establishes requirements for companies with respect to their management of private user data, and it provides civil penalties and a private right of action for certain violations and breaches. This Comment examines whether it is the job of individual state legislatures or Congress to enact legislation for the purpose of protecting consumer data. This Comment analyzes how the First Amendment, preemption, and the Dormant Commerce Clause come into conflict with the CCPA. The benefits and the drawbacks of empowering states to act as laboratories for democracy are also examined. This Comment articulates the view that one robust and comprehensive federal law should be enacted and have preemptive effect. The federal government can provide important data protection and privacy thresholds, and states should have the flexibility to provide additional enforcement mechanisms to meet their local needs.","","California,Consent,Consumer protection,Consumers,Data collection,Data integrity,Education,Europe,General Data Protection Regulation,Internet,Legislation,Personal information,Privacy,Scandals,Social networks,Software,United States--US","",""

The research was a continuation of an ongoing cooperation between The Netherlands Public Library Association and the Department of Information Sciences, University of Zagreb. A questionnaire was developed based on previously conducted interviews with librarians and survey of recent literature on anonymity. It was carried out online via a special link on the web site of The Netherlands Public Library Association and sent by e-mail to selected libraries in Croatia. Replies obtained from 65 Dutch and 33 Croatian libraries of all types have been compared and commented in the paper. The research shows that despite existing differences in library facilities librarians in both countries have not yet become fully aware of all aspects of privacy issues that new services provided by the new technology have brought about, nor received adequate training or taken appropriate measures. Further research on library practices regarding data protection and measures and steps to be taken by libraries in order to improve the present inadequacies can be envisaged in future.

The latest examples of such regulation are state and federal laws that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving their personal information. These laws, proposed in the wake of highly publicized data spills, seek to punish the breached entity and to protect consumers by requiring the entity to notify its customers about the security breach. There are competing approaches, however, to how the law is to mandate release of information about data leaks. This Article finds that the current statutes' focus on reputational sanction is incomplete. An important function of breach notification is mitigation of harm after a data leak. This function requires a multiinstitutional coordinated response of the kind that is absent from current policy proposals. This Article advocates creation of a coordinated response architecture and develops the elements of such an approach. Central to this architecture is a coordinated response agent (CRA) that oversees steps for automatic consumer protection and heightens mitigation. This Article also proposes a bifurcated notice scheme that lets firms know that the CRA is watching and is scrutinizing their decision whether or not to disclose information about a breach to the affected individuals. Moreover, the CRA will set in motion automatic protective measures on behalf of the breached consumers. Finally, the CRA will regulate the content of notification messages to reflect the nature of the data breach.

Emerging applications utilize such data to make inferences about our physiological and health states, provide health diagnosis, and contribute to wellbeing improvements. The common approach for such applications is to collect data, either using mobile applications or special hardware, e.g., wearables, and store them on a third party storage provider. This results in many unconnected data silos of self-quantification data. Researchers and industry, advocate for a common personal storage space, to conquer the myriad of small chunks of data, deemed to be lost/forgotten in the long term. The benefits of such co-located personal data are tremendous, specifically with regards to personalized medicine, treatment, and health care. However, the centralized storage of data exacerbates the privacy and security concerns that the IoT ecosystem is facing today. In this position paper, we advocate the necessity of privacy and security guarantees for the paradigm of co-located storage of personal health data. We envision two core security functionalities: true end-to-end encryption, such that only encrypted data is stored in the cloud and secure sharing of encrypted data, without disclosing data owner's secret keys. We discuss the challenges in adopting such an end-to-end encryption paradigm while preserving the cloud's basic processing functionalities over encrypted data and how to cryptographically enforce access control.","","Encrypted Processing, IoT, Privacy, Secure Sharing,Homomorphic Encryption","",""

In order to generate recommendations, the service needs to access various types of user data such as previous product purchasing history, demographic and biographical information. However, users are sensitive to disclosure of personal information as it can be easily misused by malicious third parties. Consequently, there are unavoidable security concerns which will become known through attempted unauthorized access while providing the recommendation services. In order to protect against breaches of personal information, it is necessary to obfuscate the user information by means of an efficient encryption technique while simultaneously generating the recommendation by making true information inaccessible to the system. To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving recommender system using homomorphic encryption, by which the system can provide recommendations without knowing the actual ratings. Our approach is based on the ElGamal cryptosystem by which both addition and multiplication of plaintexts can be performed. The performance of the proposed scheme shows significantly high accuracy in-terms of computation and communication costs as well as outperforming other existing solutions.","","Computers--Computer Engineering,Data privacy,Encryption,Homomorphic encryption,Multiplication,Personal information,Privacy,Recommender systems","",""

This research study assesses the emerging risks and threats that arise from the increasing prevalence of employee-owned IoT devices in the new wave of IT-consumerism within enterprise premises. Most enterprises have adapted to the change brought by the personal-IT devices such as laptops, smartphones, and cloud applications, and have introduced security policies of either allowing under Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) environment, or completely restricting its usage in preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information assets. Existing research has started focusing on possible threats of employee use of IoT devices that are outside the control of IT management. This study presents a theoretical explanation of three key aspects that are discussed in the existing scholarship: threat dimension, detection, and prevention of IoT enabled Insider threat.A systematic meta-analysis comprising of 15 research studies in current scholarship examining IoT enabled Insider threats in the workplace. Through analyzing the reported measurements and consolidating findings through systematic classification in various themes, this document identifies and systematically highlights various specific attack vectors, detection mechanism of IoT enabled malicious and unintentional threats, attack incidents/scenarios and ways and means to prevent the insider threat emerging from employee use of personal/consumer IoT devices. Based on the findings, a framework of IS research and responses to IoT enabled Insider threat by integrating and extending the work done on understanding such risks. The framework highlights the gravity of risk areas and challenges in preventing sensitive data assets of enterprises for future research.","","information assets, information security, insider threat, iot network/devices, personal-it, security and privacy risks,iot-enabled insider threat","",""

After demonstrating the security breach problem, the Note begins by discussing California's pioneering data breach notification law, which requires breached entities to notify those affected that their personal information has been compromised. Drawing on various provisions found in California's notification law, the Note evaluates current state and federal data breach laws. To further explore the relationship between federal and state enforcement, two recent data breaches, the ChoicePoint and TJX breaches, are discussed in-depth. The Note then examines proposed federal and state legislation to strengthen the argument that data breach laws, which currently focus on notification, must also advance to breach prevention. Finally, the Note proposes a solution for preventing data breaches by increasing liability for merchants who fail to meet heightened security standards based on those used in the credit card industry.

The most important variation on the SBIA has been the introduction of a risk-based exception, allowing affected entities to avoid notification based on their own assessment that the risk of harm is less than a statutorily defined standard. The SBIA defines a "breach of the security of the system" as unauthorized acquisition of computerized data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information. Because data security breach notification laws are a relatively recent phenomenon, a fair assessment of the effect of risk-based triggers must wait until courts have reviewed actual decisions not to report.

Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users choose or are assigned an ID and password or other authenticating information that allows them access to information and programs within their authority. Network security covers a variety of computer networks, both public and private, that are used in everyday jobs conducting transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals. Networks can be private, such as within a company, and others which might be open to public access. Network security is involved in organizations, enterprises, and other types of institutions. It does as its title explains: It secures the network, as well as protecting and overseeing operations being done. The most common and simple way of protecting a network resource is by assigning it a unique name and a corresponding password Network security has become more important to personal computer users, organizations, and the military.

Our methodology consists of two parts: first, we use confirmatory factor analysis to validate the latent constructs used in the main model; and then we proceed with model estimation using OLS and ordered probit techniques. This study fills the gap in the existing body of knowledge by analysing different perceptions of the existing legislation and government effort to protect online privacy in the context of sociodemographic characteristics of respondents, computer anxiety, individual desire to maintain control of personal information online, as well as intensity and diversity of online activities. Our results indicate that perceived effectiveness of government regulation reduces online privacy concern whereas computer anxiety has a major positive impact on online privacy concern.

Equifax is one of the nation's largest credit reporting agencies,6 and there is little question that it recently suffered one of the most significant data breaches in U.S. history.7 The Equifax hack resulted in the loss of vital information - names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and, in some instances, driver's license numbers - for 143 million people, impacting nearly half the U.S. population.8 Because of Equifax's failure to apply a critical software patch,9 average consumers will now be forced to actively monitor their financial information for decades.10 Moreover, our national security is at risk, with unprecedented potential for future cyberattacks, cybercrime, foreign financial blackmail, and other hostile nation-state activities.11 America's lawmakers initially approached the Equifax hack with bipartisan anger, peppering Richard Smith, the former Chief Executive officer, with questions about software vulnerabilities, security practices, and consumer remediation.12 Several Members also proposed legislation meant to impose additional regulations on Equifax, and the larger credit reporting industry.13 In the ensuing weeks, however, "the aftermath of the breach played out like a familiar script ... white-hot, bipartisan outrage, followed by hearings and a flurry of proposals that went nowhere."15 Notably, Equifax had aggressively lobbied Congress in the year prior, spending {\$}1.1 million to counter legislation intended to improve the industry's data security and victim notification procedures.16 Americans still deserve answers.[...]American consumers deserve an effective and critical solution that goes beyond mere legislation to create a whole-of-government approach to cybersecurity.17 The Equifax hack should be viewed as a triggering event for worthwhile government reform and increased public-private cooperation, creating a model that is both scalable and adaptable to multiple industries.[...]in an attempt to remedy existing deficiencies, this article contains a novel and creative proposal for reform which includes measures designed to turn our current reactive stance on corporate security into an active model of cyber defense."28 Ironically, many individuals compromised by the Equifax hack had never even interacted with the company.29 Due to the nature of the credit reporting industry, Equifax's business model relies on collecting, selling, and securing the financial information of millions of Americans.30 In fact, much of the information does not result from activities or requests of the actual consumers themselves.31 It is instead generated as a result of routine credit checks of individuals living or working in the United States.32 Unfortunately, this type of information is a prime target for hackers.33 If malicious actors are able to break through the security defenses of one of these credit reporting agencies, they instantly have access to a cyber warehouse of data, a robust collection of consumer information otherwise unavailable in one central location.34 The Department of Homeland Security alerted Equifax officials on March 8, 2017 that they needed to fix a critical security vulnerability in their software.35 Company officials disseminated the alert internally but failed to manually patch the application.36 This single point of failure would prove to be catastrophic.37 Once the breach was made public through a nationwide press release, Equifax set up a website for consumers to determine if their PII had been compromised.38 This solution had several shortcomings.39 Consumers were understandably hesitant to enter additional personal information to see if their PII had been breached.40 They worried that it would only compound the problem.41 Equifax also recommended signing up for a one-year credit monitoring service called TrustedlD.42 Unfortunately, this free service required users to submit to mandatory arbitration.43 In other words, anyone who used TrustedID would be forbidden to sue, join a classaction suit, or benefit from a class-action settlement.44 Moreover, the one-year protection plan fell far short of what was needed for aggrieved customers.","","Chief executive officers,Computer privacy,Computer security,Credit reports,Data integrity,Ethics,Governmental reform,Hackers,Internet crime,Law,Legislation,National security,Social security numbers,United States--US","",""

With the help of 'new social media' applications, like Facebook and Twitter, Internet and mobile phone users can conduct real-time exchanges with millions of people across the globe. Following the Introduction, this Article begins, in Part I, with a discussion of how these tools were used by protesters around the world in 2011. Part II discusses how the same tools were used by governments, both democratic and authoritarian, to respond to the violence and mayhem during that year. In Part III, I turn to a discussion of the relevant policy concerns, first in the American, then the Canadian, legal contexts. It is significant that Canada is the first country to complete an extensive investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. As a result, Facebook users across the world now enjoy stronger privacy protections for their personal information, in terms of how it is collected, used and disclosed. In conclusion, I note that this case has important implications for other online social networking sites, even those based in other countries, which are collecting and using the personal information of Canadians in a way that does not comport with Canadian privacy laws.

It is a kind of attack in which phishers use spoofed emails and fraudulent web sites to trick people into giving up personal information. Victims perceive these emails as trusted, while in reality they are the work of phishers interested in identity theft. Web site phishing attacks usually start with an e-mail that arrives in the victim's mailbox pretending to be a legitimate and known entity. Usually, the mail claims some urgent steps to be taken by the user to avoid blocking of user account and direct him to a web page asking him to enter private information. But the web page is not legitimate and has no association with the organization it claims to be. Hence, the number of phishing fraud is continuing to grow, and the costs of the damages caused are increasing day by day. Therefore, there is the urgent need for anti-phishing solutions and recently have been identified, a number of solutions to mitigate phishing attacks have been proposed.","","phishing,web security","",""

We use a three-layer model of user privacy concerns to relate them to system operations (data transfer, storage and processing) and examine their effects on user behavior. In the second part of the paper we develop guidelines for building privacy-friendly systems. We distinguish two approaches: "privacy-by-policy" and "privacy-by-architecture." The privacy-by-policy approach focuses on the implementation of the notice and choice principles of fair information practices (FIP), while the privacy-by-architecture approach minimizes the collection of identifiable personal data and emphasizes anonymization and client-side data storage and processing. We discuss both approaches with a view to their technical overlaps and boundaries as well as to economic feasibility. The paper aims to introduce engineers and computer scientists to the privacy research domain and provide concrete guidance on how to design privacy-friendly systems.

In this paper, we therefore introduce a Privacy by Design approach for IoT applications called DISPEL. It provides a configuration method enabling users to specify globally, which application may access what data for which purpose. Privacy protection is then applied at the earliest stage possible, i. e., directly on the IoT devices generating the data. Data transmission is protected against unauthorized access and manipulation.

But we are approaching a dramatic "phase change" as we move from genetics to genomics: when sequencing the entire genome of a person becomes sufficiently cheap as to become a routine operation, as is likely to happen in the coming decades, then each DNA examination will expose a wealth of very sensitive personal information about the examined individual, as well as her relatives. In this interdisciplinary discussion paper we highlight the complexity of DNA-related privacy issues as we move into the genomic (as opposed to genetic) era: the "driftnet" approach of comparing scene-of-crime samples against the DNA of the whole population rather than just against that of chosen suspects; the potential for errors in forensic DNA analysis and the consequences on security and privacy; the civil liberties implications of the interaction between medical and forensic applications of genomics. For example, your kin can provide valuable information in a database matching procedure against you even if you don't; and being able to read the whole of a sampled genome, rather than just 13 specific markers from it, provides information about the medical and physical characteristics of the individual.Our aim is to offer a simple but thought-provoking and technically accurate summary of the many issues involved, hoping to stimulate an informed public debate on the statutes by which DNA collection, storage and processing should be regulated.","","cold and hot hits, data protection, dna database, human genome project, informational privacy, kin privacy,forensic genomics","",""

Design/methodology/approach - various survey methods have been used in the work integrated. Documental analysis method has been used in analysis of scientific literature, legal acts and other documents, where aspects of legal data protection requirements have been included. Legal documents analysis method together with logical-analytic method has been used in analysing Directive 95/46/EU, Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council and jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. Comparative method has been applied for revealing difference between particular cloud services contracts and also comparing the compliance of cloud services contracts to requirements of basic European data protection principles, established in the international documents.   Findings - from the brief analysis of selected consumer oriented cloud service providers, it may be implied that more or less all the legal principles, established in the legal acts, are reflected in the privacy policies and/or service agreements. However, it shall be noted that there is a big difference in wording of the analysed documents. Regarding other principles, all examined cloud service providers do not have indemnification provisions regarding unlawful use of personal data.   Research limitations/implications - the concept of the contract was presented in a broad sense, including the privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of the service providers. In accordance with the content of the principles, the authors grouped data protection principles, applied in cloud services into fundamental and recommendatory.   Practical implications - the research results will be helpful for cloud service providers, dealing with personal data of data subjects (natural persons).   Originality/value - the mentioned research of cloud provider contracts examined 4 sets of standard terms and conditions of cloud service providers targeting individual consumers. The following personal data protection principles were evaluated: transparency, purpose specification and limitation, erasure of data, confidentiality, availability, integrity, indemnification.

This research examines the privacy policies of large U.S. companies to assess the substance and quality of their stated information practices. Six factors are identified that indicate the extent to which a firm is dependent upon consumer personal information, and therefore more likely to develop high quality privacy statements. The study's findings provide practical and theoretical implications for information privacy issues, particularly for consumers who need to determine whether or not to disclose their personal identifying information to firms. The results illustrate the complexity involved in managing personal private information.

The advances in information technologies have further increased these concerns. This is because the increasing power and sophistication of computer applications offers both tremendous opportunities for individuals, but also significant threats to personal privacy. Autonomous agents and multi-agent systems are examples of the level of sophistication of computer applications. Autonomous agents usually encapsulate personal information describing their principals, and therefore they play a crucial role in preserving privacy. Moreover, autonomous agents themselves can be used to increase the privacy of computer applications by taking advantage of the intrinsic features they provide, such as artificial intelligence, pro-activeness, autonomy, and the like. This article introduces the problem of preserving privacy in computer applications and its relation to autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. It also surveys privacy-related studies in the field of multi-agent systems and identifies open challenges to be addressed by future research.

Considering the lack of empirical studies, as well as the considerable uncertainty in the way personal data protection is implemented across the European Union (EU), the paper offers insights on the topic. Qualitative text analysis of semi-structured interviews with employers from the service sector (N=10) and the field of media and communication (N=15), as well as employers from organisations which had experienced various problems due to things their employees had posted on social media (N=14), and employees from the financial sector (N=15) were carried out to explore whether the data protection principles, which can be viewed as the most important guidelines for employers in the EU, are actually followed in their everyday SNS data processing practices. Even though the data protection principles emphasise the need for fair, purposeful, transparent, minimal and accurate processing of personal data, our interviews with employers and employees reveal that the actual SNS processing practices rarely live up to the standards. Our findings indicate that there is a growing mismatch between the social reality and legal requirements regarding data subjects.","","Computer networks,Data integrity,Data processing,Data protection,Employees,Employers,Ethics,Interdisciplinary aspects,Interviews,Mass media,Networking,Political Science,Qualitative research,Service industries,Social media,Social networks,Social reality,Standards,Structured interviews,Uncertainty,data protection principles,employees,employers,social media","",""

This web-based single sign-on (SSO) scheme is enabled by OAuth 2.0, a web resource authorization protocol that has been adopted by major service providers. The OAuth 2.0 protocol has proven secure by several formal methods, but whether it is indeed secure in practice remains an open question. We examine the implementations of three major OAuth identity providers (IdP) (Facebook, Microsoft, and Google) and 96 popular RP websites that support the use of Facebook accounts for login. Our results uncover several critical vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim user's profile and social graph, and impersonate the victim on the RP website. Closer examination reveals that these vulnerabilities are caused by a set of design decisions that trade security for implementation simplicity. To improve the security of OAuth 2.0 SSO systems in real-world settings, we suggest simple and practical improvements to the design and implementation of IdPs and RPs that can be adopted gradually by individual sites.","","oauth 2.0,web single sign-on","",""

Miller reflects a growing trend among the courts to adopt a narrow code approach to employee liability under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The case exacerbates the existing circuit split and reinforces the need for reconciling when an employee accesses a computer "without authorization." While resolution from the judiciary remains remote, Congress is engaged in a lively debate over the proper interpretation of the term "without authorization." Recent legislative proposals suggest that Congress has united in support of limiting liability for unauthorized access under the CFAA to the circumvention of technological barriers. Support for this restrictive interpretation signifies that until the ambiguity in the law is clarified, future undecided courts should follow in the Fourth Circuit's footsteps and adopt the code approach to determine employee liability under the CFAA.

But the days when an organization's chief executive would walk the plant and point out safety or manufacturing concerns to the floor supervisor are long gone, despite the popularity of "undercover boss" type programming. It is much more likely that C-Suite executives have very little visibility into the day-to-day processes and tools their employees utilize, as the knowledge economy has increased worker specialization and employee tasks are much closer to bespoke processes. In response to this new type of working environment, employees are choosing their own tools, preferences, and applications, and integrating those into their organization's day-to-day activities. This in turn, may cause difficulties associated with top-down management of information, security governance and strategic planning. Traditional office paraphernalia-like photo frames and potted plants-are now internet of things (IOT)-enabled bring-your-own-devices (BYOD) which, quite unlike the plants pose significant challenges and risks to the organization's information technology infrastructure and create further challenges associated with insider threats, whether intentional or not. This technological revolution, its impact on worker activity and an increased possibility of intentional and unintentional insider threats is not without a silver lining. The underpinnings of the technologies that allow workers to better do their day-to-day work can also enable executives to focus on the important data points of an employee's behaviors and activities, one can then summarize and present those data points in an intelligible way to support and provide a defensible platform for corporate decision making. In this paper, we highlight some of these modern tools and explain how they may be used within the organization to look at a number of insider threats, including ongoing fraud and corporate malfeasance. We also looked at unintentional "bad practices" that, while not directed towards corporate harm may expose the organization to data breach or other leakage issues and some of the newest trends that incorporate behavioral analytics to identify those employees most likely to engage in harmful activities, before the employees have taken the first "wrong" step down that path.

While this common approach provides value, we challenge the assumption that this approach tells the entirety of the data loss story, especially since it is difficult to define true markers of loss. Instead, we assert that data loss prevention strategies deserve a nuanced approach, including a consideration of what data loss truly means to the organization. Our nuanced approach to data loss evaluates what data loss actually means for the organization and factors this into the solution suite an organization employs to prevent the loss. To clearly consider the full data loss story and choose the best individual or combination of solutions, we assert that the organization may need to consider and define data loss according to a number of factors important to the eventual remediation strategy. Headline-making, intentional, and malicious data loss may remain the focus of the traditional approach and the primary consideration for many organizations. But the nuanced approach explored in this paper-which includes unintentional employee data sharing and unintentional data deletion-should also be incorporated into a more encompassing understanding of data loss when determining a strategy and attendant measures. Data loss measurement also requires considerations as to how it is defined by statute and regulation (as disclosure laws differ by region); from whose perspective the loss is evaluated, as various stakeholder perspectives may include business people with a defined interest in the information, information technology professionals who support that work, lawyers (internal and external) to the business, third party contractors, customers, and day-to-day users of the data (especially in those sectors protecting personal data such as health information); and whether the data loss was categorized as confidential or sensitive, thus deserving of protection from unauthorized access or exposure. Based on these additional considerations of risk and stakeholder perspective, we assert that the considerations presented in this paper will provide a better understanding of data loss, and that their utilization will aid organizations when developing more holistic and relevant data loss prevention strategies.","","Computers--Computer Security,Intrusion detection systems,Network security,Prevention,Taxonomy","",""

The purpose of this research is to develop a new model to help e-service practitioners and researchers in the evaluation of e-service security and its effect on quality and intention to use e-services.Design/methodology/approachAccording to the literature, 13 security dimensions are extracted. Then, exploratory factor analysis is applied to reduce the number of security dimensions. This step is implemented based on end-users' perception. Afterward, a hierarchical structure of e-service security is established to calculate the weights of security dimensions applying analytical hierarchy process method by contribution of e-service experts and providers. Finally, structural equation modeling using LISREL is applied to test the proposed theoretical model.FindingsResults indicates that confidentiality, integrity, privacy, authentication, non-repudiation and availability are antecedents of consumers' perceived security in e-service. Considering the high significance of perceived security, it is concluded that enhanced feelings of security will result in improved perception of quality. Furthermore, it is found that users will intend to use e-service if they feel that the quality of e-service is high.Originality/valueFew studies have been done on users' adoption behaviors of e-services and even those few have not investigated users' security perception as a major factor affecting users' intention to use e-services. Considering the increasing concerns of users about the security of their personal information and how it affects their adoption behaviors, there is a need to conduct more studies on the factors involved in this procedure. In this study, the concept of security from both perspective of objective security and subjective security is evaluated.","","26:Security and Protection (CI),45411:Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses,Analytic hierarchy process,Banking,Behavior,Business And Economics--Management,Computer security,Consumers,Customer services,Electronic banking,Electronic commerce,Factor analysis,International conferences,Internet,Network security,Online instruction,Perception,Perceptions,Personal information,Privacy,Quality of service,Structural hierarchy,Studies,Technology Acceptance Model,Web sites","",""

The study investigates a hierarchical model of individual traits, information privacy orientation and consumer privacy concerns.              Design/methodology/approach              - The empirical research utilizes structural equation modeling to analyze the responses from 964 respondents.              Findings              - The results suggest that consumer attitudes toward data collection programs associated with personal shopping information (e.g. retail loyalty card programs) are determined through a hierarchical model of personal traits and contextual-dependent variables. Specifically, the authors find that the compound traits of risk orientation and need for cognition influence the situational trait of information privacy orientation which leads to the surface trait of consumer privacy concern and ultimately attitude toward the information collection program.              Practical implications              - The results suggest several means to increase participation in data collection programs. Although high need for cognition and high risk orientation cannot be changed, communication plans can provide guarantees that mitigate perceived risk associated with sharing personal information and highlight the information value to the individual's sharing of information.

The privacy-preserving concept has arisen from the usage of database resources, which sometimes leads to the sharing of personal identifying information (PII). Adding or updating privacy and security concerns in system applications represents a difficult task for system developers because they need to track all program code to detect where privacy and security methods should be inserted. At the same time, they have to define which piece of code needs to be applied for different privacy and security policies. All of these concerns accumulate in the problem of scattering and tangling of system software. A widely-suggested but under-used solution to these problems is that of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). This paper proposes a new system for enforcing privacy-preserving concepts in order to ensure safe communication between distributed system nodes through the use of AOP. The idea based on the use of a smart server node called a judgment node (JN) to deal with data forwarding between the distributed system's nodes. Cryptographic algorithms are adopted in this work as a tool controlled by the JN to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data. We will present a novel approach which divides the data into portions with each part encrypted depending on the key of the authorized node used to process it. We use AOP characteristics for dealing with all of these concerns through the addition and removal of code dynamically to ensure a high level of performance. We use AOP as a core tool to modularize the privacy and security concerns, and to increase the clarity, maintainability and reusability of system software.","","aspect-oriented programming, distributed systems, privacy-preservation,aspectJ","",""

Any change at the social level affects more or less the internal mechanisms of the organization. Amendments to international law on the processing of personal data also have effects on these information structures. From this perspective, we intend to analyze, in a comprehensive way, the main areas of influence that privacy and privacy laws have upon the library. Thus, we investigated the library-user relationship, library-employee, and some of the ethics of information issues. Obviously, on a national scale, all these ideas will have a specific treatment after the unitary analysis of the intersection of legislation with the field of practical data activity. We consider that approaches related to the convergence of the personal data processing with the ethics of information and the main practical procedures that will be implemented in Romania have not only a theoretical justification but above all, became a prerequisite to act rightful.Alternate abstract:Bibliotecile rom{\^{a}}neşti sunt instituţii puternic ancorate {\^{i}}n mediul social, prin care işi duc la {\^{i}}ndeplinire rolul de pol cultural şi educaţional al comunităţii.

This model is a combination of interfaces and internal mechanisms which can be adopted by any OSN having similar architecture to Facebook in managing third party applications, without much structural changes. The model implemented in Web interface connects with Facebook application programming interface and evaluates its efficacy using test cases.FindingsThe results show that the PBAC model can facilitate user awareness about privacy risks of data passed on to third party applications and allow users who are more concerned about their privacy from releasing such information to those applications.Research limitations/implicationsThe study provides further research in protecting users' privacy in OSNs and thus avoid the risks associated with that, thereby increasing users' trust in using OSNs.Originality/valueThe research has proven to be useful in improving user awareness on the risk associated with sharing private information on OSNs, and the practically implemented PBAC model guarantees full user privacy from unwanted disclosure of personal information to third party applications.","","14.11:COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY -,Access control,Access to information,Computers--Internet,Identity,Information management,Melbourne Victoria Australia,Personal information,Privacy,Social networks,Third party,User interfaces","",""

In this ambitious project five technological tools (face recognition, voice recognition, writing style analysis, typing rhythm, plagiarism analysis) have been developed and piloted at seven universities. Their role for mutually trusted assessment in the educational process is discussed. Assessment activities in typical engineering subjects are shown. It is pointed out that assessment functions are management functions with a key decision making role. Pilot studies within the TeSLA project have shown additional effects leading to the expansion of its application areas.

Countries such as South Africa aim to take advantage of the EHR by implementing a national EHR system. While this has a number of benefits that are in the best interests of the patient, it also creates security and privacy risks to patients' information. Patient information has been identified as the most sensitive type of personal information. Unlike other types of personal information, it contains confidential information about the patient that cannot be changed such as the patient's medical history. Thus, the EHR needs to be protected from both unauthorised entities and misuse by authorised clinicians. This can be achieved through the regulation of the national EHR system. Although regulations state that personal information must be protected, they do not specify what processes must be followed in order to comply with them. This paper proposes a model to address this problem by indicating the components that are needed in order to assist compliance. The proposed model, which was informed by a scoping review and thematic analysis, is discussed in the context of South Africa's future national EHR system with the focus on the Protection of Personal Information (PoPI) Act.","","NHI, National Health Insurance, PoPI Act, access control, electronic health record, privacy, regulations,security","",""

Such hacks may involve a one-off event or a sustained breach operation over a period of time. The management of cyberrisk clearly needs to be high on the boardroom agenda. Network security alone cannot fully address the issue: experience has shown that even top-notch, state-of-the-art cybersecurity is vulnerable. Boards need to take a proactive approach to ensure that they identify key risks impacting a business and prioritize the protection of critical information. Insurance can also play a vital role in managing cyberrisks.

Yet victims still face uncertainty when deciding whether and where to file cases against companies or other institutions that may have mishandled their information. This is especially true if the victims have not yet experienced a financial harm, like identity theft, as a result of a data breach. Much of the uncertainty revolves around the standing doctrine and the Supreme Court's guidance (or lack thereof) on what constitutes a substantial risk of harm sufficient to establish an injury in fact. Federal circuit courts have come to divergent results in data breach cases based on the Supreme Court's guidance. This Note analyzes these divergent results and shows that the circuits are not as far apart as some commentators have suggested. This Note then proposes two possible clarifying measures-one judicial and one legislative. The judicial solution is a test the Supreme Court should adopt for evaluating standing in data breach litigation. The test would have courts assess three factors and would allow plaintiffs who have not yet had their data misused to establish standing. Under the test, courts would examine (1) whether the breach was targeted; (2) whether the thief attained information that could lead to financial harm; and (3) whether any portion of the compromised data has been misused. For the legislative solution, this Note proposes language for a private right of action that could be inserted into federal legislation, either as part of comprehensive privacy legislation or in sector-specific privacy legislation.","","44511:Supermarkets and Other Grocery (except Conve,Consumer protection,Credit cards,Data integrity,Grocery stores,Law,Legislation,Personal identification numbers,Privacy,Supreme Court decisions,United States--US","",""

These digital intermediaries will save us time by purchasing grocery items, transferring bank accounts, and subscribing to cable. The literature has only begun to hint at the paradigm shift needed to navigate the legal risks and rewards of this coming era of automated commerce . This Article begins to fill that gap by surveying legal battles related to contract exit, data access, and deception that will determine the extent to which automated assistants are able to help consumers to search and switch, potentially bringing tremendous societal benefits. Whereas observers have largely focused on protecting consumers and sellers from digital intermediaries' market power, sellers like Amazon, Comcast, and Wells Fargo can also harm consumers by obstructing automated assistants Advancing consumer welfare in the automated era requires not just consumer protection, but digital intermediary protection. The Article also shows the unpredictable side of eliminating switching costs. If digital assistants become pervasive, they could gain the ability to rapidly direct millions of consumers to new purchases whenever a lower price or new innovation becomes available. Significantly accelerated consumer switching-what I call hyperswitching-does not inevitably harm society. But in the extreme it could make some large markets more volatile, raising unemployment costs or financial stability concerns as more firms fail. This new kind of disruption could pose challenges for commercial and banking regulators akin to those familiar to securities regulators, who deploy idiosyncratic tools such as a pause button for the stock market. Even if sellers prevent extreme hyperswitching, managers may strategically prepare for hyperswitching with economically costly behavior such as hoarding liquid assets or forming conglomerates to provide insurance against a sudden exodus of customers. The transaction-cost-focused literature has missed macro-level drawbacks. The regulatory architecture reflects these scholarly gaps. One set of agencies regulates automated assistants for consumer protection and antitrust violations but does not go beyond those microeconomic inquiries. Nor do they prioritize strengthening digital intermediaries Regulators with more macroeconomic missions lack jurisdiction over automated assistants. The intellectual framework and regulatory architecture should expand to encompass both the upsides and downsides of digital consumer sovereignty.","","92615:Regulation, Licensing, and Inspection of Mis,Antitrust,Automation,Bailouts,Competitive advantage,Consumer protection,Consumers,Efficient markets,Law,Regulation of financial institutions,Stock exchanges,Wall Street Reform {\&} Consumer Protection Act 2010-","",""

Therefore, domestic and international lawmakers need to regulate such matter through legislation and international agreements.   The exchange of passenger name record (PNR) data in transnational flights has been regulated both by EU law and international agreements signed with third countries, such as Australia, Canada, and the US.   The latest EU–Canada PNR agreement was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) by the European Parliament before its entry into force, pursuant to the procedure provided for by Article 218(11) TFEU, allowing EU institutions to ask for an opinion of the CJEU.   In July 2017, the CJEU in Opinion 1/15 ruled the draft agreement incompatible with Article 7 (right to privacy), 8 (right to data protection) and 52 (principle of proportionality) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Consequently, the agreement between the EU and Canada will be renegotiated.   This analysis reads Opinion 1/15 in light of the previous case law of the CJEU about privacy and national security and examines its potential implications on both institutional balances and international relations. Focusing on some novelties and noteworthy passages of Opinion 1/15, this Article claims that the vital interest of democracy can be reconciled with the need to overcome security threats, as the CJEU's stance showed.","","92811:National Security,92812:International Affairs,Agreements,Australia,Canada,Europe,International agreements,International relations,Law,National security,Privacy,Transnationalism,United States--US","",""

The Blood Service Biobank (BSB) in Finland was recently established to recruit blood donors willing to give broad biobank consent. The aim of the present study is to understand how the blood bank context influences views on donating samples and health data. We organised 61 interviews and 10 group discussions with current and potential blood donors. Using qualitative content analysis, we identified three discussion frameworks that summarise the results. We found that frequent blood donors associated the voluntary act of donation with caring for patients. The blood donation experience was considered to accommodate biobank participation, but also allowed critical observations on the integration of research data collection into blood donation. Research participants identified an important difference between the blood bank and biobank contexts. In the biobank context, the focus shifts from donating blood to patients into donating personal and genetic data for research use. Blood donors' anxiety over data use was balanced with their experience of the trustworthiness of the Blood Service. These experiences indicated that the new biobanking activity could be trusted to a familiar organisation. To build donors' trust, biobanks should invest in their institutional reputation, donor experience and dialogue with donors. These findings can be applied to other institutions that are considering setting up biobanks with broad consent for personal data use.","","Anxiety,Biology--Genetics,Blood {\&} organ donations,Blood banks,Blood donors","",""

The framework is based on a software product line architecture. It dynamically selects personalization methods during runtime that meet the current privacy constraints. Since dynamic architectural reconfiguration is typically resource-intensive, we conducted a performance evaluation with four implementations of our system that vary two factors. The results demonstrate that at least one implementation of our approach is technically feasible with comparatively modest additional resources, even for websites with the highest traffic today. To gauge user reactions to privacy controls that our framework enables, we also conducted a controlled experiment that allowed one group of users to specify privacy preferences and view the resulting effects on employed personalization methods. We found that users in this treatment group utilized this feature, deemed it useful, and had fewer privacy concerns as measured by higher disclosure of their personal data.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","","1200:Social policy,2600:Management science/operations research,4300:Law,5240:Software {\&} systems,7500:Product planning {\&} development,9130:Experimental/theoretical,Analysis,Architecture,Computers--Computer Programming,Law,Performance evaluation,Privacy,Product lines,Software,Studies,Users,Web sites","",""

Firstly, we construct a node key tree based on flash hierarchical structure, and propose a key derivation encryption algorithm to generate data key to encrypt user data. Furthermore, we combine partial block erasure with partial key deletion method to delete both the ciphertext data and the partial key component after expired. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is able to implement data privacy protect and secure deletion of invalid data.

Today, nearly one-third of healthcare providers use mobile devices to access EHRs from cloud systems. With the healthcare industry facing a new reality, healthcare applications are steadily impacting the mobility and security of how caregivers and hospitals are authorized to access vital information. However, mobile services are still not generally allowed to operate with highly sensitive and personal data, mainly due to the lack of a defined security standard, low protection of data transferred through the mobile and wireless network and no standard and widely accepted user authentication method that ensure confidentiality. In this paper, a proposed privacy-preserving EHR system using ciphertext-multi authority attribute-based encryption (CPMA-ABE) will be built. In this system, patients can encrypt their EHRs and store them on semi-trusted cloud servers such that servers do not have access to sensitive EHR contexts. Meanwhile patients maintain full control over access to their EHR files, by assigning fine-grained, attribute-based access privileges to selected data users, while different users can have access to different parts of their EHR. The system also provides extra features such as populating EHR from different EHR cloud systems using ABE.","","cloud computing, electronic health records, privacy, role based access control, security,ABE and encryption","",""

Many users store their personal information in the cloud for easy and convenient access anywhere and at any time. A law enforcement agency cannot directly access the electronic evidence, but requires the assistance of an intermediary such as the service provider and/or cloud service provider for access to the stored evidence. It has to be established whether there is a legal obligation on a company (cloud service provider) to gather the evidence of a cloud service user stored on a server outside the country's territorial borders on behalf of the law enforcement agency. This is also the focus point in MicrosoftCorporation v United States of America (referred to as the "Microsoft-Ireland" test case). If a law enforcement agency must use Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) for international law enforcement, it should be ascertained whether the MLAT process is fast and cost effective. If the MLAT process is not efficient, a country may employ data localisation as an alternative law enforcement method which will impact on cloud computing.

Though the law is not yet in effect, compliance is a big concern, and there is a much uncertainty surrounding the effort that will be required to be compliant. The security principle of least privilege plays a significant role in privacy and privacy protection, and consequently features in much privacy legislation. A particular area of concern is the Android software market in which application developers are (for the most part) unregulated. The uncertainties around compliance, and the ease of entry to the Android software market exposes the unwary application developer to the (eventual, but unavoidable) force of POPIA. Moreover, the access control model in Android allows applications access to personal information stored on user devices (once they are installed with consent). This paper reports on an investigation into Android security permissions and the alignment of these permissions with POPIA. Twenty-one Android applications - designed and released for the South African market - were reviewed, and for each, the requested access were examined, and how this compares to the required permissions according to the application's end-user agreement. Compliance of the applications was assessed in accordance with chapter three of POPIA (which defines eight conditions for the lawful processing of personal information); however, the investigation was limited to what was observable without needing access to intellectual property. Findings indicate that, for the application versions investigated many are not fully compliant with POPIA, and that the granularity of permissions in Android may cause significant problems for South African applications. This also indicates that free-lance developers may incur significant risk in developing and releasing software if care isn't taken with the permission model. Moreover, it indicates that training and awareness of POPIA - especially for software developers - should receive more attention.","","Access control,Accountability,Compliance,Computer privacy,Computer science,Computer security,Computers--Computer Security,Cooperation,Curricula,Intellectual property,Investigations,Legislation,Markets,Personal information,Principles,Privacy,Problems,Smartphones,Software,Software development,South Africa,Uncertainty,United States--US","",""

In particular, today's Web ecosystems are presided over by multisided online platforms, extracting and analyzing personal data in the absence of express obligations to protect and promote their users' interests. Not surprisingly, over the past twenty years scholars have begun reaching back to "old school" common law doctrines for guidance. One promising legal field entails fiduciary duty-based relationships, which have a robust, globe-spanning history stretching hundreds of years. The latest such approach is the information fiduciaries (IF) model, introduced by academics Jack Balkin and Jonathan Zittrain. The IF model posits that OSPs should be required to abide by fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and confidentiality with regard to their end users. A recent draft paper by Lina Khan and David Pozen, however, sees an unsolvable incongruity between a mandated duty of loyalty, and both the corporate law of Delaware, and the financial imperatives of online advertising-based companies such as Facebook. As it turns out, while the IF model 's creators invoke the fiduciary duty of loyalty, in reality their model relies on mandated obligations rooted only in care and confidentiality. Fortunately, the IF model does not exhaust the richness and depth of fiduciary law doctrine. Another proposed approach is the "digital trustmediary" (DTM), a cornerstone feature of the GLIAnet project2). The DTM model involves entities providing advanced digital service to their clients, while voluntarily operating under heightened fiduciary duties of loyalty, care, and confidentiality. The opt-in DTM model is positioned as a well-considered alternative to a current Web ecosystem generally lacking in bona fide fiduciary-like relationships. The IF model of mandated care, and the DTM model of voluntary loyalty, present two different but complementary approaches to injecting greater trust and accountability in the Web. Finally, other tenets of the common law remain available for exploration. Indeed, what could be termed "digital common law " holds the potential to contribute usefully to modern day conversations about the role of digital technologies in society.","","Common law,Confidentiality,Corporate law,End users,Fiduciaries,Fiduciary responsibility,Internet service providers,Loyalty,Technology: Comprehensive Works","",""

This article briefly reviews what happened in the 1970s, the factors that led to production of the guidelines, and some of the key points in them. We highlight the success of the guidelines, but also the shortcomings, and what is happening now to bridge the gap and ask whether an international binding convention or standard is needed. We conclude with a few modest suggestions for ensuring a new convention or standard has teeth.In the 1970s, the decade before the OECD Guidelines were promulgated, some countries had already begun to enact privacy laws applicable to the public and private sectors. The world's first data protection law was passed in the German Land of Hessen in 1970. In 1977, a Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz or BDSG) followed. Sweden's Data Act of 1973 was the first comprehensive national act on privacy in the world. France's Data Protection Act, enacted in 1978 and amended in 2004, covers personal information held by government agencies and private entities.In the U.S., antecedents of the 1974 Privacy Act were the American Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 and a 1973 report of the Department of Health Education and Welfare (HEW) on fair information practices (FIP).In the seven-year stint between 1973 and 1980, one-third of the OECD's 30 Member countries enacted legislation intended to protect in dividuals against abuse of data related to them and to give individuals the right of access to data with a view to checking their accuracy and appropriateness. Some countries were enacting statutes that dealt exclusively with computers and computer-supported activities. Other countries preferred a more general approach irrespective of the particular data processing technology involved. The OECD became concerned that these disparities in legislation might "create obstacles to the free flow of information between countries."The OECD Council recognized that Member countries have a common interest in protecting privacy "and in reconciling fundamental but competing values such as privacy and the free flow of information." This persisting tension between data protection and the free flow of information is already obvious in the OECD Guidelines of 1980, which were intended to facilitate a harmonization of national legislation, without precluding the establishment of an international Convention at a later date.As it turned out, the Council of Europe (CoE), another international organization mainly concerned with the fostering of human rights and democracy in Europe, was working simultaneously in that direction---that of an international convention. As European countries began to adopt data protection laws, pressure grew for more uniformity of these laws. From a human rights perspective, the CoE began preparing an international convention on data protection that nevertheless also included provisions dealing with data processing abroad. Efforts were made to avoid unnecessary differences between the texts produced by the two organizations; thus, the set of basic principles of protection proposed by the OECD and the CoE are similar in many respects.On Sept. 17, 1980, the Committee of Ministers of the CoE adopted the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, the first legally binding international instrument in data protection. The convention sought to establish basic principles of data protection, to reduce restrictions on transborder data flows on the basis of reciprocity, and to bring about cooperation between national data protection authorities (DPAs). Parties to the convention are required to apply the principles in their domestic legislation.Six days later, on Sept. 23, 1980, the OECD Council adopted its guidelines on transborder data flows. Although efforts were made to minimize the differences, some do occur nevertheless. The OECD Guidelines are not legally binding, whereas the CoE convention is binding on those countries that ratify it. The CoE convention only applies to personal data that are "automatically" processed, whereas the guidelines are valid for the processing of data in general, irrespective of the particular technology employed. The OECD Guidelines, unlike the CoE convention, do not mention the need to establish national data protection authorities, a crucial requirement in European data protection rules. But, all in all, the principles formulated are similar.The OECD Guidelines and the CoE convention both recognize the need to harmonize data protection standards. Like the CoE convention, the OECD Guidelines aimed to prevent interruptions in the international flow of data, but are not to be construed as a set of general privacy protection principles per se. The guidelines explicitly say that invasions of privacy by candid photography, physical maltreatment, or defamation are outside their scope.","","","",""

Therefore, when an image is encrypted by TPE, it is possible for the thumbnail image to retain similar appearance after encryption, allowing a quick overview of the encrypted image.

Preventing Unauthorized Access to Enterprise Systems Using a Location-based Logical Access Control proposes a framework that uses time and location in preventing and defending against data breaches. The framework was developed using Java with an Eclipse IDE. The database was designed using MySQL and locations were collected using Google Maps API. Users registered at different locations in a university campus were unable to access another's account in the database because they were both outside the known location and tried to do this at off-work hours. Users were registered with username and password at specified locations. The users are then made to login from same and different locations with correct username and passwords. it was discovered that access to the database was only given when the username and password was correct and location was same as at registered or as allowed by an administrator. The system was found to protect against unauthorized access arising from stolen login credentials and unauthorized remote logins from malicious users.","","Access control,Administrator,Colleges {\&} universities,Computer security,Computers--Computer Networks,Data integrity,Databases,Digital mapping,Espionage,Google Gears,Location,Passwords,Unauthorized Access,geolocation","",""

At the same time, aging populations have increased the need for expanded and more efficient elderly care services. Fortunately, elderly people can now wear sensing devices which relay data to a personal wireless device, forming a body area network (BAN). These personal wireless devices collect and integrate patients' personal physiological data, and then transmit the data to the backend of the network for related diagnostics. However, a great deal of the information transmitted by such systems is sensitive data, and must therefore be subject to stringent security protocols. Protecting this data from unauthorized access is thus an important issue in IoT-related research. In regard to a cloud healthcare environment, scholars have proposed a secure mechanism to protect sensitive patient information. Their schemes provide a general architecture; however, these previous schemes still have some vulnerability, and thus cannot guarantee complete security. This paper proposes a secure and lightweight body-sensor network based on the Internet of Things for cloud healthcare environments, in order to address the vulnerabilities discovered in previous schemes. The proposed authentication mechanism is applied to a medical reader to provide a more comprehensive architecture while also providing mutual authentication, and guaranteeing data integrity, user untraceability, and forward and backward secrecy, in addition to being resistant to replay attack.","","Architecture,Body area networks,Chemistry--Analytical Chemistry,Cloud computing,Computer security,Electronic devices,Health care,Internet of Things,Lightweight,Older people,Protocol (computers),Sensors,Software reliability,Weight reduction,Wireless communications,Wireless networks","",""

The debates surrounding these privacy concerns, especially related to cloud computing (another ubiquitous concept), have not enjoyed a clear, unitary discourse, as IT developments have almost out-run the rhythm in which legal scholars were analysing recent threats to privacy, and especially internet privacy. This paper aims to reveal the characteristics of data portability as a legal concept in the modern world of privacy and data protection; it focuses on a few aspects of the reform proposed by the Commission, highlighting the detailed provisions of the right to data portability in the larger context of the reform. It also discusses data portability's impact on competition and its links to international data transfers, as they will be regulated in the new EU data protection law. It concludes that data portability is a right of the data subject strongly connected with a fundamental right to the free development of human personality, and is also a function that cloud-computing services worldwide will have to provide in order to increase users', customers' or consumers' trust.","","4310:Regulation,5140:Security management,5250:Telecommunications systems {\&} Internet communi,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9175:Western Europe,92812:International Affairs,Data integrity,Europe,International standards,Law,Regulatory reform,Right of privacy,Studies","",""

Despite judicial cautions that the doctrine is unfit for the digital age, it persists as one of privacy's greatest limitations. However, in Carpenter v. United States, the Supreme Court significantly circumscribed the thirdparty doctrine. Although the Court explicitly limited its holding to historical cell-site location information, Carpenter paves the way for enhancing expectations of privacy in many types of data. This Comment argues that Carpenter applies to browsing history collected by third-party cookies; therefore, individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their browsing history that is unabridged by the third-party doctrine. Like historical cell-site location information, browsing history collected by thirdparty cookies is comprehensively detailed and collected involuntarily and pervasively. In arguing that Carpenter applies beyond the Court's feeble restraints, this Comment derives an emerging expectation of privacy in the comprehensiveness of data from the Court's repeated focus on how granular data can reveal personal information. An expectation of privacy that turns on the comprehensiveness of data offers new grounds to strengthen privacy online and in the digital age.","","45411:Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses,Advertising,Computer privacy,Electronic commerce,Internet,Jurisprudence,Law,Personal information,Right of privacy,Search warrants,Social networks,Society,Supreme Court decisions,Surveillance,Third party,United States--US,Web analytics","",""

Therefore, the purpose of this research is to construct and empirically assess a causal model that explains how web users intend to share their personal information online. In particular, this theoretical model proposes that social exchange attitude mediates the impacts of trust and privacy concern on the intention of sharing personal information. An sample as large as 1249 is collected to test the proposed model. The empirical data strongly supports the hypotheses and suggests that trust and concern for privacy directly and indirectly affects the intention to share personal information via the attitude of social exchange. The direct and indirect impacts of trust are both positive.

Furthermore, we found that children's concerns fit into four child-adversary threat models: child-peers, child-media, child-strangers, and child-parents. Their concerns differed from the five threat models held by the parents: child-peers, child-media, child-strangers, child-technology, and child-self. Parents used a variety of protection strategies to minimize children's exposure to external threats.

These attacks are somewhat restricted by Automated Turing Tests (ATTs, e.g., captcha challenges) that attempt to mandate human assistance. ATTs are not very difficult for legitimate users, but always pose an inconvenience. Several current ATT implementations are also found to be vulnerable to improved image processing algorithms. ATTs can be made more complex for automated software, but that is limited by the trade-off between user-friendliness and effectiveness of ATTs. As attackers gain control of large-scale botnets, relay the challenge to legitimate users at compromised websites, or even have ready access to cheap, sweat-shop human solvers for defeating ATTs, online guessing attacks are becoming a greater security risk. Using deception techniques (as in honeypots), we propose the user-verifiable authentication scheme (Uvauth) that tolerates, instead of detecting or counteracting, guessing attacks. Uvauth provides access to all authentication attempts; the correct password enables access to a legitimate session with valid user data, and all incorrect passwords lead to fake sessions. Legitimate users are expected to learn the authentication outcome implicitly from the presented user data, and are relieved from answering ATTs; the authentication result never leaves the server and thus remains (directly) inaccessible to attackers. In addition, we suggest using adapted distorted images and pre-registered images/text as a complement to convey an authentication response, especially for accounts that do not host much personal data.","","authentication, online password guessing,deception","",""
