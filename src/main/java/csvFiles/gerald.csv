People are often the weakest link in an otherwise secure computer system and, consequently, are targeted for social engineering attacks. Social Engineering is a technique used by hackers or other attackers to gain access to information technology systems by getting the needed information (for example, a username and password) from a person rather than breaking into the system through electronic or algorithmic hacking methods. Such attacks can occur on both a physical and psychological level. The physical setting for these attacks occurs where a victim feels secure: often the workplace, the phone, the trash, and even on-line. Psychology is often used to create a rushed or officious ambiance that helps the social engineer to cajole information about accessing the system from an employee.Data privacy legislation in the United States and international countries that imposes privacy standards and fines for negligent or willful non-compliance increases the urgency to measure the trustworthiness of people and systems. One metric for determining compliance is to simulate, by audit, a social engineering attack upon an organization required to follow data privacy standards. Such an organization commits to protect the confidentiality of personal data with which it is entrusted.This paper presents the results of an approved social engineering audit made without notice within an organization where data security is a concern. Areas emphasized include experiences between the Social Engineer and the audited users, techniques used by the Social Engineer, and other findings from the audit. Possible steps to mitigate exposure to the dangers of Social Engineering through improved user education are reviewed.","","access control, physical security, user education,social engineering","",""

In particular, this theoretical model proposes that social exchange attitude mediates the impacts of trust and privacy concern on the intention of sharing personal information. An sample as large as 1249 is collected to test the proposed model. The empirical data strongly supports the hypotheses and suggests that trust and concern for privacy directly and indirectly affects the intention to share personal information via the attitude of social exchange.

This is a relationship which needs to be explored in-depth because of three concurrent trends -- first, the push towards e-government, where citizen-government transactions are increasingly conducted online; second, the growing use of smart cards, RFID tags and other portable information collection and transmission devices by governments and businesses; and third, calls for greater government surveillance, both online and offline, to counter terrorism in the post 9/11 environment.While prior research has dealt with individual concerns about online privacy and individual concerns about government surveillance, studies exploring the relationship between the two are limited. This study seeks to fill that gap by surveying Internet users across five cities which vary in their experience of government surveillance and the use of national ID cards -- Bangalore, New York, Seoul, Singapore and Sydney.Personal information privacy is the individual's ability to personally control information about him/herself. Such information could include anything from one's birth registration details, to the identities and coordinates of one's next-of-kin, income and expenditure patterns and even health records. In countries where day-to-day transactions with commercial and government entities are increasingly being conducted online, involving the electronic collection of personal information, online privacy is the principal manifestation of personal information privacy.As e-commerce and e-government services become more pervasive, Internet users' concerns about online privacy are likely to grow. Individual online privacy concerns have been classified into improper acquisition, improper use and privacy invasion.12 Concerns about improper acquisition relate to unauthorized access to personal information, improper collection of one's private information and improper monitoring of consumers' online activities. Concerns about improper use cover unauthorised analysis of consumers' online shopping behavior and the subsequent business-to-business transfer of such analyses. Concerns about privacy invasion refer to the transmission of information to Internet users without their prior consent, such as spam, as well as the improper storage of personal information. To maintain their online privacy, Internet users can engage in self-protective behaviour such as opting out, using privacy enhancing technologies, reading privacy policies, or checking trust marks.Studies have been conducted to test concern about online privacy as a function of demographic variables. Sheehan10 found that gender was a significant factor in that female consumers were generally more concerned about their personal privacy than male consumers. In general, older consumers2 were also more concerned about online privacy. The relationship between consumers' experience with the Internet and online privacy concerns has also been explored. Bellman et al.2 reported that consumers' online privacy concerns diminished with Internet experience. As more consumers use the Internet and the average level of experience rises, online privacy concerns should gradually diminish. In general, studies have demonstrated that demographic variables and Internet-related experiences significantly affect Internet users' concern about online privacy.","","","",""

This notwithstanding, contextual services are rapidly proliferating into most niches of society, catalysed by technological advancements in sensing, ubiquity and mobile computing.

Consequently, contextual applications have propagated into personal, community, government and corporate services. Unfortunately, these services are seldom developed with onset personal information leak concerns. As a result, personal information pieces often leak in their handling, eroding the users' privacy. Privacy erosion is attributed to information leaks through covert acquisitions and re-purposing of legitimate data. Privacy loss from such erosion exposes individuals to significant harm often intractable or costly. This study identifies and sensitises information handling vulnerabilities on their privacy implications in context-aware services. We assert the need for stakeholders in contextual services to deliberate privacy implications of context throughout its life cycle as opposed to, detached focus at collection, transmission or usage points. Notably, privacy threats will intensify as computing further invades the sacred precincts of our private, public and domestic lives.","","anonymity, personal information, privacy,context-aware","",""

Privacy is strongly penetrated by today's surveillance systems. It has to be ensured that both the derived video analysis results and the adequately filtered imaging stream (if still required) are only accessible to adequate user groups to address the privacy dilemma. A vision based sensor should be applicable in the same application fields as other non-camera based application specific sensors, e.g., photoelectric sensors used in mens' restroom facilities (urinals/pissoirs) -- with the same confidence and trust. Related work is surveyed and a first concept is introduced to address these demands. It is based on a smart camera approach and various certification and authentification mechanisms to allow application specific sensors to use the power of the visual modality without the traditional drawbacks. Different use cases are discussed from the point of view of the persons surveilled, persons intending to modify and persons utilizing the results.

This article briefly reviews what happened in the 1970s, the factors that led to production of the guidelines, and some of the key points in them. We highlight the success of the guidelines, but also the shortcomings, and what is happening now to bridge the gap and ask whether an international binding convention or standard is needed. We conclude with a few modest suggestions for ensuring a new convention or standard has teeth.In the 1970s, the decade before the OECD Guidelines were promulgated, some countries had already begun to enact privacy laws applicable to the public and private sectors. The world's first data protection law was passed in the German Land of Hessen in 1970. In 1977, a Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz or BDSG) followed. Sweden's Data Act of 1973 was the first comprehensive national act on privacy in the world. France's Data Protection Act, enacted in 1978 and amended in 2004, covers personal information held by government agencies and private entities.In the U.S., antecedents of the 1974 Privacy Act were the American Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 and a 1973 report of the Department of Health Education and Welfare (HEW) on fair information practices (FIP).In the seven-year stint between 1973 and 1980, one-third of the OECD's 30 Member countries enacted legislation intended to protect in dividuals against abuse of data related to them and to give individuals the right of access to data with a view to checking their accuracy and appropriateness. Some countries were enacting statutes that dealt exclusively with computers and computer-supported activities. Other countries preferred a more general approach irrespective of the particular data processing technology involved. The OECD became concerned that these disparities in legislation might "create obstacles to the free flow of information between countries."The OECD Council recognized that Member countries have a common interest in protecting privacy "and in reconciling fundamental but competing values such as privacy and the free flow of information." This persisting tension between data protection and the free flow of information is already obvious in the OECD Guidelines of 1980, which were intended to facilitate a harmonization of national legislation, without precluding the establishment of an international Convention at a later date.As it turned out, the Council of Europe (CoE), another international organization mainly concerned with the fostering of human rights and democracy in Europe, was working simultaneously in that direction---that of an international convention. As European countries began to adopt data protection laws, pressure grew for more uniformity of these laws. From a human rights perspective, the CoE began preparing an international convention on data protection that nevertheless also included provisions dealing with data processing abroad. Efforts were made to avoid unnecessary differences between the texts produced by the two organizations; thus, the set of basic principles of protection proposed by the OECD and the CoE are similar in many respects.On Sept. 17, 1980, the Committee of Ministers of the CoE adopted the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, the first legally binding international instrument in data protection. The convention sought to establish basic principles of data protection, to reduce restrictions on transborder data flows on the basis of reciprocity, and to bring about cooperation between national data protection authorities (DPAs). Parties to the convention are required to apply the principles in their domestic legislation.Six days later, on Sept. 23, 1980, the OECD Council adopted its guidelines on transborder data flows. Although efforts were made to minimize the differences, some do occur nevertheless. The OECD Guidelines are not legally binding, whereas the CoE convention is binding on those countries that ratify it. The CoE convention only applies to personal data that are "automatically" processed, whereas the guidelines are valid for the processing of data in general, irrespective of the particular technology employed. The OECD Guidelines, unlike the CoE convention, do not mention the need to establish national data protection authorities, a crucial requirement in European data protection rules. But, all in all, the principles formulated are similar.The OECD Guidelines and the CoE convention both recognize the need to harmonize data protection standards. Like the CoE convention, the OECD Guidelines aimed to prevent interruptions in the international flow of data, but are not to be construed as a set of general privacy protection principles per se.

Data are routinely filtered before being shared with content-service providers, and users or data custodian services can participate in making controlled data-sharing decisions. Introducing a PDV gives users flexible and granular access control over data. To reduce the burden on users and improve usability, we explore three mechanisms for managing data policies: Granular ACL, Trace-audit and Rule Recommender.

In this paper, a framework is presented to support data sharing between public organizations for collaboration purposes. The framework focuses on solutions towards optimal data sharing and integration while ensuring the security and privacy of individuals. Data sharing is based on the need-to-know principle, that is, data are only made available when they are required to perform core processes. To facilitate this, an approach is introduced in the form of a trusted third party that manages access control to personal information and thus helps to protect the privacy of individuals. It is argued that the proposed framework is suitable for data integration and sharing on various levels. An example of best practices of data sharing in the Netherlands shows how this framework facilitates data sharing to perform knowledge transfer and other higher-level tasks.","","data integration,data sharing,public sector,trusted third parties","",""

The PST Framework considers information security, information management and data protection legislation as privacy hygiene factors, representing the minimum processes for effective privacy practice. The framework also includes privacy influencers - developed from previous research in information security culture, information ethics and information culture - and privacy by design principles. The framework helps to deliver good privacy practice by providing: 1) a clear hierarchy of the activities needed for effective privacy practice; 2) delineation of information security and privacy; and 3) justification for placing data protection at the heart of those activities involved in maintaining information privacy.

Users, however, often feel uncomfortable providing such information. In a privacy-minded design of recommenders, users are free to decide for themselves what data they want to disclose about themselves. But this decision is often complex and burdensome, because the consequences of disclosing personal information are uncertain or even unknown. Although a number of researchers have tried to analyze and facilitate such information disclosure decisions, their research results are fragmented, and they often do not hold up well across studies. This article describes a unified approach to privacy decision research that describes the cognitive processes involved in users' “privacy calculus” in terms of system-related perceptions and experiences that act as mediating factors to information disclosure. The approach is applied in an online experiment with 493 participants using a mock-up of a context-aware recommender system. Analyzing the results with a structural linear model, we demonstrate that personal privacy concerns and disclosure justification messages affect the perception of and experience with a system, which in turn drive information disclosure decisions. Overall, disclosure justification messages do not increase disclosure. Although they are perceived to be valuable, they decrease users' trust and satisfaction. Another result is that manipulating the order of the requests increases the disclosure of items requested early but decreases the disclosure of items requested later.","","Privacy, decision-making, information disclosure, recommender systems,user experience","",""

These attacks are somewhat restricted by Automated Turing Tests (ATTs, e.g., captcha challenges) that attempt to mandate human assistance. ATTs are not very difficult for legitimate users, but always pose an inconvenience. Several current ATT implementations are also found to be vulnerable to improved image processing algorithms. ATTs can be made more complex for automated software, but that is limited by the trade-off between user-friendliness and effectiveness of ATTs. As attackers gain control of large-scale botnets, relay the challenge to legitimate users at compromised websites, or even have ready access to cheap, sweat-shop human solvers for defeating ATTs, online guessing attacks are becoming a greater security risk. Using deception techniques (as in honeypots), we propose the user-verifiable authentication scheme (Uvauth) that tolerates, instead of detecting or counteracting, guessing attacks. Uvauth provides access to all authentication attempts; the correct password enables access to a legitimate session with valid user data, and all incorrect passwords lead to fake sessions. Legitimate users are expected to learn the authentication outcome implicitly from the presented user data, and are relieved from answering ATTs; the authentication result never leaves the server and thus remains (directly) inaccessible to attackers. In addition, we suggest using adapted distorted images and pre-registered images/text as a complement to convey an authentication response, especially for accounts that do not host much personal data.","","authentication, online password guessing,deception","",""

An asset is a persistent item or property of value and has an owner. Attacks damage assets; security controls prevent attacks to preserve their value. Expected attack loss is calculated from the value of the attacked assets. This common analytic approach works satisfyingly if an IT system runs in an enclosed environment within an organization. Nowadays, IT systems are accessed and used across organizational boundaries by a multitude of independent stakeholders employing them for their own interests and with particular expectations regarding their trustworthiness. The asset paradigm cannot support estimating consequences of security incidents that may harm these complex stakeholder collaborations. We propose to model the stakeholder collaboration networks and to analyze scenarios of how security incidents affect relationships between stakeholders. Collaboration continuously creates value for all participants. Security incidents change the behavior of stakeholders and their willingness to collaborate, but in complicated ways. Transmission factors characterizing a relationship help us to assess the impact of incidents.

The book's 12 core chapters are organized into three thematic sections. “Defining the Discipline” examines the 1960s and 1970s when the field of computer science was taking form at the National Science Foundation, Stanford University, and through ACM's notable efforts in education and curriculum standards. “Broadening the Profession” looks outward into the wider society as ACM engaged with social and political issues-and as members struggled with balancing a focus on scientific issues and awareness of the wider world. Chapters examine the social turbulence surrounding the Vietnam War, debates about the women's movement, efforts for computing and community education, and international issues including professionalization and the Cold War. “Expanding Research Frontiers” profiles three areas of research activity where ACM members and ACM itself shaped notable advances in computing, including computer graphics, computer security, and hypertext. Featuring insightful profiles of notable ACM leaders, such as Edmund Berkeley, George Forsythe, Jean Sammet, Peter Denning, and Kelly Gotlieb, and honest assessments of controversial episodes, the volume deals with compelling and complex issues involving ACM and computing.

Emerging applications utilize such data to make inferences about our physiological and health states, provide health diagnosis, and contribute to wellbeing improvements. The common approach for such applications is to collect data, either using mobile applications or special hardware, e.g., wearables, and store them on a third party storage provider. This results in many unconnected data silos of self-quantification data. Researchers and industry, advocate for a common personal storage space, to conquer the myriad of small chunks of data, deemed to be lost/forgotten in the long term. The benefits of such co-located personal data are tremendous, specifically with regards to personalized medicine, treatment, and health care. However, the centralized storage of data exacerbates the privacy and security concerns that the IoT ecosystem is facing today. In this position paper, we advocate the necessity of privacy and security guarantees for the paradigm of co-located storage of personal health data. We envision two core security functionalities: true end-to-end encryption, such that only encrypted data is stored in the cloud and secure sharing of encrypted data, without disclosing data owner's secret keys. We discuss the challenges in adopting such an end-to-end encryption paradigm while preserving the cloud's basic processing functionalities over encrypted data and how to cryptographically enforce access control.","","Encrypted Processing, IoT, Privacy, Secure Sharing,Homomorphic Encryption","",""

Be it search engine, recommendation system, streaming service, interactive agent, or collaborative system, multimedia plays a critical role in ensuring full understanding of multimodal sensory signals, robust modeling of user-content interaction, natural and rich communication experience, and scalable system deployment. The goal is to utilize unique contributions from each modality, integrate complementary synergies, and achieve the best performance and novel functions beyond what's separately available in each individual medium. In this community, most contributors also maintain strong activities in other disciplines such as networking, computer vision, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. But the field of multimedia is unique in offering a rich and dynamic forum for researchers from "traditional" fields to collaborate and develop new solutions and knowledge that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines.The field enjoys a long history of vibrant research. For example, the flagship ACM SIGMM Multimedia Conference was established in 1993, celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. The community also has several well-known conferences and journals organized by ACM, IEEE, and other groups, attracting a large number of researchers and practitioners from around the world. However, despite the prolific research activities and outcomes, there has been less effort toward developing books that serve as an introduction to the rich spectrum of topics in this broad field. Most of the few books available today either focus on specific subfields or basic background. There is a lack of tutorial-style materials covering the active topics being pursued by the leading researchers at frontiers of the field.SIGMM launched a new initiative to address this need in 2015, by selecting and inviting 12 rising-star speakers from different subfields of multimedia to deliver plenary tutorial style talks at ACM Multimedia 2015. Each speaker discussed challenges and the state of the art within their prospective research areas in a general manner to the broad community. Topics covered were comprehensive, including multimedia content understanding, multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction, multimedia social media, and multimedia system architecture and deployment. Following the very positive responses to the talks, these rising-star speakers were invited to expand the content covered in their talks to chapters that can be used as reference materials for researchers, students, and practitioners. Each resulting chapter discusses problems, technical challenges, state-of-the-art approaches and performances, open issues, and promising directions for future work. Collectively, the chapters provide an excellent sampling of major topics addressed by the community as a whole. This book, capturing outcomes of such efforts, is well positioned to fill the aforementioned needs by providing tutorial-style reference materials for frontier topics of multimedia.Section 1 of the book includes five chapters that are focused on analysis and understanding of multimedia content. Topics covered range from analysis of video content, audio content, multimodal content about interaction of freestanding conversational groups, and analysis of multimedia data in the encrypted format for preserving privacy on cloud servers, to efficient approximate similarity search techniques for searching over large-scale databases.First, Zuxuan Wu et al. review current research on understanding video content by detecting the classes of actions or events contained in a given video clip and generation of full-sentence captions describing the content in each such video. Unlike previous surveys, this review focuses on solutions based on deep learning, reflecting the recent trend of research in this area. The chapter also gives extensive reviews of the datasets used in state-of-the-art research and benchmarking efforts.Extending the modality from video to audio, in Chapter 2, Gerald Friedland et al. introduce the field of computer audition, aiming to develop the theory behind artificial systems that can extract information from sound. This chapter reviews the research datasets available, appropriate representations needed for audio, and a few challenging problems such as automatic extraction of hierarchical semantic structures from audio content and automatic discovery of high-level semantic concepts from massive audio data and associated metadata.The holy grail of research for the multimedia community is to be able to integrate and fuse information extracted from multiple modalities of data. In Chapter 3, Xavier Alameda-Pineda et al. present an excellent example and emergent research challenges in the application of detecting social interaction among freestanding conversational groups. The chapter includes overviews of research issues, approaches, evaluation of joint estimation of head and body poses using multiPreface modality data (such as wearable sensors and distributed camera networks), and results of detecting dynamic group formation of interacting people.Chapter 4 addresses a novel emerging topic prompted by the popular approach to multimedia analysis using cloud computing servers. When multimedia data is sent to the cloud for storage or processing, there is a risk of privacy breach via unauthorized access by third parties to the content in the cloud. Pradeep Atrey et al. review state-of-the-art methods and open issues for processing multimedia content in the encrypted domain without needing to convert data to the original format. This allows content to stay in its protected form while useful analysis is performed on it.In Chapter 5, Herv{\'{e}}e Jeundefinedou surveys efficient techniques for finding approximate solutions for similarity search, which is of particular interest when searching massive multimedia data like images, videos, and audio recordings. Jeundefinedou considers various performance factors like query speed, memory requirement, and search accuracy. Multiple frameworks based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH), quantization/ compression, and hybrid combinations are also reviewed in a coherent manner.In Section 2 of the book, the emphasis shifts from content analysis to humancentered aspects of multimedia computing. This new focus goes beyond extraction of semantic information from multimedia data. Instead, the broad research scope incorporates understanding of users and user-content interaction so as to improve effectiveness of multimedia systems in many applications, such as search and recommendation.Under the human-centric theme, Chapter 6, authored by Peng Cui, discusses the evolution of multimedia computing paradigms from the data-centric, to the content-centric, and recently to the human-centric. Cui presents a new framework, called social-sensed multimedia computing, to capture many key issues involved and advances achieved, including understanding of user-content interaction behavior, understanding of user intent, multimedia representation considering user intention, and integration of heterogeneous data sensed on multimedia social networks.Chapter 7 follows the human-centric theme and further moves the focus from processing individual multimedia data streams to processing a large number of heterogeneous streams in different modalities involving a large number of people. Analysis of such massive streams offers the possibility of detecting important situations of society, such as socio-economic affairs, as well as the living environment. Vivek Singh provides an overview of the problem definition, research framework, and the EventShop toolkit he developed for application development in this emerging area.The extension to the human-centric computing paradigm also calls for formal mathematical theories and tools for explaining the phenomena observed, such as the information propagation behaviors and the occurrences of information cascades on social networks. In Chapter 8, Marian-Andrei Rizoiu et al. review stochastic processes such as the Hawkes point process for modeling discrete, interdependent events over continuous time. These are strongly related to patterns corresponding to retweet cascade events on social media. Successful models like these can help researchers understand information dissemination patterns and predict popularity on social media.Interaction between users and content reveals not only the intent of the user (covered in Chapter 6), but also attributes of the content as well as of the user him/herself. Such interaction can be manifested in multiple forms including explicit cues such as visual and verbal expressions, and implicit cues such as eye movement and physiological signals like brain activity and heart rate. Chapter 9 includes a survey by Subramanian Ramanathan et al. on how such implicit user interaction cues can be explored to improve analysis of content (scene understanding) and user (user emotion recognition).To support research and development of emerging multimedia topics discussed above, there is a critical need for new generations of communication and computing systems that take into account the unique requirements of multimedia, such as real-time, high bandwidth, distributiveness, major power consumption, and resource uncertainty. The popular cloud-based computing systems, though prevalent formanyapplications, are not suitable for large-scale multimedia applications such as cloud-based gaming service and animation rendering service.The last section of the book focuses on the systems aspect, covering distinct topics of multimedia fog computing (Chapter 10) and cloud gaming (Chapter 11). Cheng-Hsin Hsu et al. survey the emerging paradigm focused on fog computing, in which computing services are crowdsourced to the edge nodes or even to the client devices on the user end. This offers major potential benefits in terms of low latency, location awareness, scalability, and heterogeneity. However, it also poses many significant challenges in areas such as resource discovery, resource allocation and management, quality of service, and security. Discussion of these challenges, along with recent advances in this area, are presented in Chapter 10.Finally, as a concrete example of large-scale distributed multimedia computing systems, Chapter 11 (by Kuan-Ta Chen et al.) presents a comprehensive survey of cloud gaming, with emphasis on the development of platform and testbed, test scenarios, and evaluation of performance, in order to enhance optimal design of various components of the complex cloud gaming systems. In particular, the chapter overviews extensive research in areas such as open-source platforms, cloud deployment, client design, and communication between gaming servers and clients.The scope of this book is by no means exhaustive or complete. For example, it can be expanded to include other important topics such as (but not limited to) multimedia content generation, multimodal knowledge discovery and representation, multimedia immersive networked environments, and applications in areas like healthcare, learning, and infrastructure. Nonetheless, the comprehensive survey materials already covered in the book provide an excellent foundation for exploring additional topics mentioned above, and many other relevant fields.We would like to give sincere acknowledgment to Dr. Svebor Karaman, who has provided tremendous assistance in communicating with contributors and organizing the content of this book.

The European-wide adoption of the once-only principle is seen as a promising way to relieve businesses from the burden of submitting the same data to different public administrations multiple times, as it would enable EU Member States to share and reuse the data that another state has already collected.

Attempts to strip data sets of personally identifiable information may appear to protect privacy, but de-anonymization techniques using statistical analysis can uniquely identify a person from surprisingly little information. Strong cryptography, when implemented correctly, can provide these protections.Appropriately applied cryptography can ensure that breaches reveal nothing about the data it protects. And beyond the confidentiality guarantees from typical cryptographic applications, end-to-end cryptography can also help to ensure privacy is maintained. Sophisticated mechanisms for sharing and revoking access become approachable and inherent to the system. Integrating cryptography at a foundational level allows projects to adapt to new insights without sacrificing privacy.

However, its wide adoption in healthcare is yet to be seen, one main reason being patients' concerns for security and privacy of their sensitive medical records. These concerns can be addressed through corresponding security and privacy requirements within the system engineering process. Despite a plethora of related research, security and privacy requirements for cloud systems and services have seldomly been investigated methodically so far, whereas their individual priorities to increase the system success probability have been neglected. Against this background, this study applies a systematic requirements engineering process: First, based on a systematic literature review, an extensive initial set of security and privacy requirements is elicited. Second, an online survey based on the best-worst scaling method is designed, conducted, and evaluated to determine priorities of security and privacy requirements.Our results show that confidentiality and integrity of medical data are ranked at the top of the hierarchy of prioritized requirements, followed by control of data use and modification, patients' anonymity, and patients' control of access rights. Availability, fine-grained access control, revocation of access rights, flexible access, clinicians' anonymity, as well as usability, scalability, and efficiency of the system complete the ranking. The level of agreement among patients is rather small, but statistically significant at the 0.01 level.The main contribution of the present research comprises the study method and results highlighting the role of strong security and privacy and excluding any trade-offs with system usability. Enabling a richer understanding of patients' security and privacy requirements for adopting cloud computing in healthcare, these are of particular importance to researchers and practitioners interested in supporting the process of security and privacy engineering for health-cloud solutions. It further represents a supplement that can support time-intensive negotiation meetings between the requirements engineers and patients.","","Cloud computing, healthcare, privacy, requirements,security","",""

Numerous cases of data abuse, unauthorized sharing and leakage have been reported. Unfortunately, existing IoT systems have not only failed to prevent such cases, but often contributed to those. To address this issue, we propose a clean-slate approach to building secure and private-by-design IoT systems, in which users retain full control and ownership of their IoT data.

First, IoT applications require both software and hardware to work together across many different types of nodes with different capabilities under different conditions. Second, IoT application development involves different types of software engineers such as desktop, web, embedded, and mobile to work together. Furthermore, non-software engineering personnel such as business analysts are also involved in the design process. In addition to the complexity of having multiple software engineering specialists cooperating to merge different hardware and software components together, the development process requires different software and hardware stacks to be integrated together (e.g., different stacks from different companies such as Microsoft Azure and IBM Bluemix). Due to the above complexities, non-functional requirements (such as security and privacy, which are highly important in the context of the IoT) tend to be ignored or treated as though they are less important in the IoT application development process. This article reviews techniques, methods, and tools to support security and privacy requirements in existing non-IoT application designs, enabling their use and integration into IoT applications. This article primarily focuses on design notations, models, and languages that facilitate capturing non-functional requirements (i.e., security and privacy).

Unlike in the electronic commercial environment where the user can view the company privacy policy and indicate transaction data to be protected through opt-out mechanisms, opt-out in the mashup environment with government data is not so easy. In a mashup, a third party mashup Web application provider requests the individual's data from the government agencies through Web services. Since the data is public data not necessarily provided through an electronic interaction, individual citizens are not necessarily able to express fine-grained privacy policies on how data may be used. In addition, the government agency's privacy policy is very coarse grained, and the relative sensitivity of individual citizens is not considered. In this paper, we provide a Privacy Protection Model for Mashup Applications, using a mashup related multi-dimensional privacy protection space which includes parameters to specify mashup providers, mashup-specific operators, and mashup purposes. A personal privacy policy network is a distributed architecture where citizens can publish their individual privacy policies that can be applied to the use of their data and consulted by data providers including government agencies.","","e-government mashup services, personal privacy policy network, regulatory privacy policy, web 2.0,citizen privacy","",""

An important characteristic of big data is that data from various sources have life cycles from collection to destruction, and new information can be derived through analysis, combination, and utilization. However, each phase of the life cycle presents data security and reliability issues, making the protection of personally identifiable information a critical objective. In particular, user tendencies can be analyzed using various big data analytics, and this information leads to the invasion of personal privacy. Therefore, this paper identifies threats and security issues that occur in the life cycle of big data by confirming the current standards developed by international standardization organizations and analyzing related studies.

In this context, patterns, which are constructs encoding re-usable solutions to common problems and building blocks to architectures, can be an asset in alleviating said barrier. More specifically, patterns can be used to encode dependencies between SP properties of individual smart objects and corresponding properties of orchestrations (compositions) involving them, facilitating the design of IoT solutions that are secure and privacy-aware by design. Motivated by the above, this work presents a survey and taxonomy of SP patterns towards the creation of a usable pattern collection. The aim is to enable decomposition of higher-level properties to more specific ones, matching them to relevant patterns, while also creating a comprehensive overview of security- and privacy-related properties and sub-properties that are of interest in IoT/IIoT environments. To this end, the identified patterns are organized using a hierarchical taxonomy that allows their classification based on provided property, context, and generality, while also showing the relationships between them. The two high-level properties, Security and Privacy, are decomposed to a first layer of lower-level sub-properties such as confidentiality and anonymity. The lower layers of the taxonomy, then, include implementation-level enablers. The coverage that these patterns offer in terms of the considered properties, data states (data in transit, at rest, and in process), and platform connectivity cases (within the same IoT platform and across different IoT platforms) is also highlighted. Furthermore, pointers to extensions of the pattern collection to include additional patterns and properties, including Dependability and Interoperability, are given. Finally, to showcase the use of the presented pattern collection, a practical application is detailed, involving the pattern-driven composition of IoT/IIoT orchestrations with SP property guarantees.","","Access control,Architecture,Composition,Context,Decomposition,Design,Designers,Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT),Industrial applications,Internet of Things,Internet of Things (IoT),Interoperability,Privacy,Properties (attributes),Sciences: Comprehensive Works,Security,Semiotics,Taxonomy,dependability,interoperability,pattern taxonomy,pattern-based engineering,privacy patterns,security patterns","",""

We highlight how the economic analysis of privacy evolved over time, as advancements in information technology raised increasingly nuanced and complex issues. We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance and detract from individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences. We conclude the article by highlighting some of the ongoing issues in the privacy debate of interest to economists.

The Internet of Things (IoT), with its promise to create networks of networks, will magnify individual data privacy threats. Recent data breaches, exposing the personal information of millions of users, provide insight into the vulnerability of personal data. Although seemingly expansive, there are core individual privacy issues that are central to current big data breaches and anticipated IoT threats.

The aim of the research was to develop a reliable measurement scale for quantifying and comparing attitudes towards personal data that can be incorporated into cybersecurity behavioural research models. Such a scale has become necessary for understanding individuals' attitudes towards specific sets of data, as more technologies are being designed to harvest, collate, share and analyse personal data.Design/methodology/approachAn initial set of 34 five-point Likert-style items were developed with eight subscales and administered to participants online. The data collected were subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and MANOVA. The results are consistent with the multidimensionality of attitude theories and suggest that the adopted methodology for the study is appropriate for future research with a more representative sample.FindingsFactor analysis of 247 responses identified six constructs of individuals' attitude towards personal data: protective behaviour, privacy concerns, cost-benefit, awareness, responsibility and security.

Partial least squares structural equation modeling is applied to the domain of cybersecurity by collecting data on users' attitude towards digital security, and analyzing how that influences their adoption and usage of technological security controls. Bayesian-network modeling is then applied to integrate the behavioral variables with simulated sensory data and/or logs from a web browsing session and other empirical data gathered to support personalized adaptive cybersecurity decision-making. Results from the empirical study show that predictive analytics is feasible in the context of behavioral cybersecurity, and can aid in the generation of useful heuristics for the design and development of adaptive cybersecurity mechanisms. Predictive analytics can also aid in encoding digital security behavioral knowledge that can support the adaptation and/or automation of operations in the domain of cybersecurity. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques applied to extract input data for the Bayesian-based models for personalized adaptive cybersecurity assistance.","","Adaptive assistance,Adaptive structures,Analytics,Bayesian analysis,Bayesian-inference,Behavioral analytics,Browsing,Computer security,Computer simulation,Computers--Computer Programming,Cybersecurity,Decision analysis,Decision making,Empirical analysis,Feasibility studies,Mathematical models,Modelling,Predictive modeling","",""

The Internet of Things (IoT), which aims to connect things to the Internet and interconnect them with each other, could have a huge impact on data generation and dissemination as there will be data streams from countless sources. The centrality of data and its countless value in today's world do not, however, end contention and controversial views about its nature. Every stakeholder looks at data from his own perspective. Merchants and the business community view data as a valuable asset and commodity that could generate huge profits. In the existing legal systems, courts traditionally excluded information (data) from the ambit of property and current statutes seem to be silent about the issue of dealing with data as property. This paper attempts to study the propertization of data in light of contemporary business practices and the existing laws through consulting some relevant statutory laws and court cases. The aim of the discussion is to pay attention to the gap between business practices and current legal protection available for data or information. This paper is believed to be useful and timely as data propertization is an ongoing contentious issue that surfaces with every new wave of datagenerated technology such as the IoT.","","Business And Economics,Business community,Dictionaries,Intellectual property,Internet of Things,Patents","",""

The data set of Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) 2014/2015 and 42 semi-structured interviews conducted with victims of cybercrime and non-victim control group participants were analysed via binary logistic regression and content analyses methods.FindingsThis research illustrated that Internet users facilitated their victimisation through their online activities. Additionally, using insecure Internet connections and public access computers emerged as risk factors for both cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent crime victimisation. Voluntary and involuntary personal information disclosure through social networking sites and online advertisement websites increased the likelihood of being a target of phishing. Deviant online activities such as free streaming or peer-to-peer sharing emerged to increase the risk of cyber-dependent crime victimisation.Research limitations/implicationsThe binary logistic regression analysis results suggested LRAT as a more suitable theoretical framework for cyber-dependent crime victimisation.

This article provides a panoramic overview on new perspective and systematic interpretation of a list published literatures via their meticulous organization in subcategories. The fundamental notions of the existing privacy preserving data mining methods, their merits, and shortcomings are presented. The current privacy preserving data mining techniques are classified based on distortion, association rule, hide association rule, taxonomy, clustering, associative classification, outsourced data mining, distributed, and k-anonymity, where their notable advantages and disadvantages are emphasized. This careful scrutiny reveals the past development, present research challenges, future trends, the gaps and weaknesses.

Data were collected from six organisations from different industry sectors through in-depth interviews with managers and from customers' through four focus groups of a high-user demographic segment. Findings - The paper identified Privacy by Design (PbD) in the area of organisations' practices as well as identifying the main areas of CPPS. These themes were used as the basis for an analysis of customer concerns instrumental to the success of e-commerce. Practical implications - The findings will inform the development of a general conceptual model. This will provide a better understanding of CPPS in general and in relation to the success of e-commerce web sites and transactional sites in particular. Originality/value - The value and the originality of the paper comes from the adoption of the "PbD" paradigm. Organisations have to explore the factors that elevate or minimise customers' concerns in relation to adopting and continuing to use online transactions. It is necessary for organisations to do this because when privacy and security practices are clearly disclosed, customers increase their intention to use, or continue to use online transactions.","","45411:Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses,5220:Information technology management,9130:Experimental/theoretical,Competitive advantage,Customer services,Customers,Data integrity,Design specifications,Electronic commerce,Internet,Library And Information Sciences,Privacy,Studies,Success,Technological change","",""

Privacy has been considered from different disciplines like sociology, psychology, law and philosophy. It is a multidisciplinary domain, having an easy concept but difficult to define. However, by reviewing all different viewpoints, it can be concluded that privacy is an individual tendency, wish and natural need to be away from others' control and surveillance. Moreover, it is the physical as well as impalpable limits of an individual who likes to be free from others intrusion.

In the modern economy, sellers are willing to offer goods and services to strangers in exchange for a promise to pay, provided the promise is backed up by data that link the buyer to a specific account or credit history. Identity theft involves acquiring enough data about another person to counterfeit this link, enabling the thief to acquire goods while attributing the charge to another person's account. In this article, we discuss what is (and is not) known about the prevalence and cost of identity theft, describe the institutional framework in which identity theft takes place, and consider some of the main policy issues associated with the problem.

As these discussions continue, some health care providers, insurers, laboratories, pharmacies, and other healthcare stakeholders are creating and retroactively digitizing our medical information with the unambiguous endorsement of the federal government. Some argue that these enormous databases of medical information offer improved access to timely information, evidence-based treatments, and complete records from which to provide care. To the extent that these claims are true, it would seem that this is a valuable asset that offers immeasurable benefit to all. Others believe this digitization to be an egregious invasion of privacy.

Consumers often have only the stated Web site policies as a guide to how their information is used, and thus on which to base their browsing and transaction decisions. However, each policy is different, and it is difficult--if not impossible--for the average user to compare and comprehend these policies. This paper presents a taxonomy of privacy requirements for Web sites. Using goal-mining, the extraction of pre-requirements goals from post-requirements text artefacts, we analysed an initial set of Internet privacy policies to develop the taxonomy. This taxonomy was then validated during a second goal extraction exercise, involving privacy policies from a range of health care related Web sites. This validation effort enabled further refinement to the taxonomy, culminating in two classes of privacy requirements: protection goals and vulnerabilities. Protection goals express the desired protection of consumer privacy rights, whereas vulnerabilities describe requirements that potentially threaten consumer privacy. The identified taxonomy categories are useful for analysing implicit internal conflicts within privacy policies, the corresponding Web sites, and their manner of operation. These categories can be used by Web site designers to reduce Web site privacy vulnerabilities and ensure that their stated and actual policies are consistent with each other. The same categories can be used by customers to evaluate and understand policies and their limitations. Additionally, the policies have potential use by third-party evaluators of site policies and conflicts.","","Computers--Software","",""

Design/methodology/approach - Using survey data, this paper models the relationship between past experience of consumers and their levels of concern, and derives the principal components that make up consumer behaviours. Findings - The components are physical prevention measures, account monitoring, agency monitoring, password security, and risky behaviour avoidance. These components were found to be almost orthogonal, implying that consumers tend to "buy into" a particular component of behaviour. The proposed model of consumer behaviour, while statistically significant, did not have high predictive value. Research limitations/implications - The survey data used were collected without reference to the model used in this paper, which limits the efficacy of the model. Practical implications - Consumers use all the behaviours in one component without regard to other components. This can leave "holes" in consumer defence against identity theft and fraud. Consumer education on identity theft and fraud needs to stress that consumers need to employ all behaviours that can minimise risk and loss. Originality/value - This paper puts forward an initial model of consumer behaviours as it relates to identity theft and fraud. The derivation of the orthogonal components of behaviour is a new and important finding.","","9130:Experimental/theoretical,Attitudes,Business And Economics--Banking And Finance,Consumer behavior,Consumers,Costs,Credit card fraud,Fraud,Identity theft,Studies","",""

These profiles contain information, which is sensitive - a reason why the information is protected from illegal use by privacy policies. This kind of information is at times referred to as online digital assets. Online digital assets are either hosted on private or government websites and online systems depending on where users are registered. There is a possibility that after death or impairment of a user, the confidentiality of online digital assets may be compromised due to absence of ownership and weak legal policies. This may result into privacy infringement of the owner, that is, the deceased or the impaired as well as other people related to the affected user such as those that have had sensitive conversations with him or her. Using Facebook as a case study, this research examined social web users' opinions on privacy and online digital assets management (DAM) after death or impairment of a user. The study used an online questionnaire to collect opinions from 22 Facebook users. Results show that the majority of respondents consider privacy and online DAM to be important issues. On the other hand, other Facebook users think that privacy in social networking websites is a mere illusion. There are also users who are not familiar with the concept of DAM and do not have any means of managing their assets in case of impairment or death.

It has been suggested that using computerised information systems could improve the accessibility of information. However, making information accessible, while maintaining confidentiality, is one of the main challenges of implementing information systems. This article presents the ED staff perspectives about the accessibility and confidentiality of information in the ED.   Method:   The authors undertook a qualitative study in March-April 2007. Data were collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews with the ED staff of an ED located in Northern England. In total, 34 interviews were conducted and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using framework analysis.   Results:   The results showed that the ED staff had role-based access to the current information systems, and these systems met only a small part of their information needs. As a result, different sources were used to get access to the needed information. Although the ED staff believed that improving the accessibility of information could be helpful in emergency care services, there were concerns about the confidentiality of information. The confidentiality of information could be threatened-for example, by sharing passwords, misusing patient information or by unauthorised staff having access to patient information.   Conclusion:   To design a system, the accessibility and confidentiality of information should be addressed in parallel. A balance between these two is needed, as the failure of each of these may negatively influence the use of the system.","","Computer terminals,Data analysis,Emergency medical care,Ethics,Hospitals,Information systems,Interviews,Legal and forensic medicine,Medical Sciences--Surgery,Physicians,Professional relationships,Qualitative research,Researchers,Workloads","",""

The well-established, tried and tested rules and regulations for behavioral and biomedical research involving human participants [18] must demonstrate voluntary participation via informed consent [19–22], perform risk assessment to determine if the probability and magnitude of potential harms are balanced against potential benefits, include those who may benefit most from knowledge gained, consider downstream societal implications, conduct an external review of study procedures before initiating any project, and develop additional protections for vulnerable stakeholders.  Do not simply delegate consideration of ethical and responsible research practices solely to research ethics boards (also known as institutional review boards [IRBs]).  The Citizen Science Association has also developed and shared materials for conducting an IRB review [28], to help build an ethics review process for the citizen science community.","","Big Data,Biocompatibility,Biology--Computer Applications,Biomedical materials,Biomedical research,Brain,Brain research,Canada,Children,Collaboration,Computer software,Consortia,Data collection,Ethics,France,Informed consent,Massachusetts,Medical research,Medical risk factors,Medicine,New York,Open access,Open science,Pharmacology,Privacy,Professional ethics,Public health,Reproducibility,Research design,Research ethics,Review boards,Risk assessment,Science,Scientists,Social media,Toxicology,United States--US,Washington DC","",""

However, it is important to understand the impact of digital evolution on fundamental rights. The right to privacy and right to information are equally essential human rights in the modern day society. Both the rights complement each other well however conflict arises when there is a potential risk of unauthorized access to personal information held by various agencies. The laws and ethical practices develop over centuries. However, technology is advancing on a mounting curve. Our laws have not been successful to keep up with the pace at which technology is advancing. Objective of this paper is to study the challenges that the right to privacy is exposed to and the deficient legal reform in a globally emergent digital environment.","","Access to information,Banking,Citizens,Data collection,Electronic government,Human rights,India,Internet,Law,National security,Personal information,Social networks,Surveillance,Technological change,United States--US","",""

IoT technology is anticipated to become an essential requirement in the development of smart homes, as it offers convenience and efficiency to home residents so that they can achieve better quality of life. Application of the IoT model to smart homes, by connecting objects to the Internet, poses new security and privacy challenges in terms of the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the data sensed, collected, and exchanged by the IoT objects. These challenges make smart homes extremely vulnerable to different types of security attacks, resulting in IoT-based smart homes being insecure. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the possible security risks to develop a complete picture of the security status of smart homes. This article applies the operationally critical threat, asset, and vulnerability evaluation (OCTAVE) methodology, known as OCTAVE Allegro, to assess the security risks of smart homes. The OCTAVE Allegro method focuses on information assets and considers different information containers such as databases, physical papers, and humans. The key goals of this study are to highlight the various security vulnerabilities of IoT-based smart homes, to present the risks on home inhabitants, and to propose approaches to mitigating the identified risks. The research findings can be used as a foundation for improving the security requirements of IoT-based smart homes.","","Chemistry--Analytical Chemistry,Computer security,Containers,Inhabitants,Internet of Things,Life assessment,Object recognition,Smart buildings,Smart houses,Vulnerability","",""

Security of code and privacy of data must be implemented in both design and programming practice to face such scenarios. In such a context, this paper proposes a software development approach, Privacy Oriented Software Development (POSD), that complements traditional development processes by integrating the activities needed for addressing security and privacy management in software systems. The approach is based on 5 key elements (Privacy by Design, Privacy Design Strategies, Privacy Pattern, Vulnerabilities, Context). The approach can be applied in two directions forward and backward, for developing new software systems or re-engineering an existing one. This paper presents the POSD approach in the backward mode together with an application in the context of an industrial project. Results show that POSD is able to discover software vulnerabilities, identify the remediation patterns needed for addressing them in the source code, and design the target architecture to be used for guiding privacy-oriented system re-engineering.","","Application security,Complex systems,Computers--Software,Context,Cybersecurity,New technology,Privacy,Privacy by Design,Reengineering,Secure architecture,Secure software development,Security,Security by design,Software,Software development,Software engineering,Source code,System re-engineering","",""

Researchers who discover flaws often face IP-based legal threats if they reveal findings to anyone other than the software vendor. This Article argues that the interplay between law and vulnerability data challenges existing scholarship on how intellectual property law should regulate information about improvements on protected works, and suggests weakening, not enhancing, IP protections where infringement is difficult to detect, lucrative, and creates significant negative externalities. It proposes a set of three reforms-"patches," in software terms-to protect security research. Legal reform would create immunity from civil IP liability for researchers who follow "responsible disclosure" rules. Linguistic reform would seek to make the term hacker less threatening either by recapturing the term's original meaning, or abandoning it. Finally, structural reform would ameliorate failures in the market for software vulnerability data by having a trusted third party act as a voluntary clearinghouse. The Article concludes by describing other areas, such as physical security, where it may be useful to reform how law coordinates IP improvements.

However, security and privacy can, and should, be treated as distinct concerns. Privacy discourse involves difficult normative decisions about competing claims to legitimate access to, use of, and alteration of information. It is about selecting among different philosophies and choosing how various rights and entitlements ought to be ordered. Security implements those choices-it mediates between information and privacy selections. This Article argues that separating privacy from security has important practical consequences. Security failings should be penalized more readily and more heavily than privacy ones, both because there are no competing moral claims to resolve and because security flaws make all parties worse off. Currently, security flaws are penalized too rarely, and privacy ones too readily. The Article closes with a set of policy questions highlighted by the privacy-versus-security distinction that deserve further research.

The consumers' perceived vulnerability is negatively affected by their level of Internet literacy and their perceived ability to control the collection and use of information. In turn, the perceived ability to control information collection and use is positively influenced by both the Internet literacy level and the social awareness of the consumer.

Building upon the non-overlapping SC and PC dimensions, we propose an Internet Users Information Transmission Security Concern (IUITSC) scale. We argue that the scale when used in conjunction with the PC scale would cover the entire gamut of SCs and PCs (SC-PC). The construct is tested in a nomological network of personality and trust. The article first develops the theoretical foundation for multiple factor structures including various first-order factor models as well as the second-order factor model.

The survey described in the paper shows that future programmers are aware of numerous threats associated with global informatization. Many threats may be reduced by users' involvement in the software process. Software developers should learn and develop cooperation with users, as emphasized in agile methodologies. It is a task for academic teachers to promote collaboration between software authors and users, to show how to organize it, and to convince programmers that it is valuable. Users' involvement requires changes in the software life cycle and in the set of established processes. Such changes, in the form of additionally established processes and phases in the software development cycle, are identified in the paper. One recommended process is the software product assessment intended to elicit feedback from users.

The conventional wisdom in both countries, whether accurate or not, is that the modern political campaign needs to be ‘data driven' to consolidate existing support and to find potential new voters and donors. The capture and consolidation of these data permit the construction of detailed profiles on individual voters and the ‘micro-targeting' of increasingly precise messages to increasingly refined segments of the electorate, especially in marginal constituencies.1 Although there are huge differences between presidential systems such as the US and European parliamentary systems, there is evidence that parties in other countries are drawing lessons from the US experience and that similar techniques are gradually entering their politics.2 There is extensive cross-national communication about these techniques through the network of political and technical consultants, who are eager to tout the benefits of micro-targeting and data-driven campaigning, and to sell the range of software applications, for both database and mobile environments.","","81394:Political Organizations,Big Data,Canada,Databases,Democracy,Elections,Europe,Law,Marketing,Political parties,Privacy,State laws,Surveillance,Trends,United States--US","",""

Specifically, two innovations that are exerting significant influence on peoples' lives - genetic testing and the Internet - and their impact on the normative conception of identity are examined. This socially oriented approach leads to several insights. First, it is shown that a host of seemingly unrelated social and legal controversies emanating from these technologies can be traced to a common tension. Secondly, it is found that despite the role identity tensions play in controversies implicating genetic testing and the Internet, these tensions are not addressed in the legal debate. The failure to address identity interests combined with the frequent failure to provide for their protection calls for the incorporation of identity interests into the legal debate. Specifically, two potential resolutions are proposed: 1. direct incorporation of an independent identity interest and 2. indirect incorporation through the readjustment of existing doctrinal tools.","","4300:Law,5250:Telecommunications systems {\&} Internet communications,8320:Health care industry,9190:United States,Debates,Genetic testing,Internet,Law,Social identity,United States--US","",""

For this purpose it considers the issue of personal identity management in terms of a framework, which distinguishes between the related processes of authentication, identification and enrolment. Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual model described in this paper is reflected against an important recent case in which issues of personal identity management are being enacted: the introduction of a UK national identity card. Both this issue and case are particularly examined in the light of the growth of e-Government in the UK. Findings - The paper relates issues associated with the technical infrastructure of e-Government with some of the costs and benefits associated with the social infrastructure of e-Government. This device offers a useful framing for a whole range of issues surrounding individual-organisation interaction in the Information Society that rely on elements of personal identity management. Research limitations/implications - In the paper the issue of personal identity management is under-represented in the Information Systems and Information Management literature. The conceptual approach adopted in the paper is used to identify areas of further research in terms of issues relevant to the technical infrastructure of e-Government. Practical implications - The paper identifies a number of personal identity management issues embedded in the technical infrastructure required for effective e-Government. Originality/value - This paper raises the importance of personal identity management to the success of the e-Government agenda. It also links classic information management issues to the issue of personal identity management and identifies the challenges for e-Government within this.

Thus, personal sensing applications that sense a user's context via his smart device have significant privacy implications. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study of privacy, trust, risks and other concerns of users with smart phone based context-aware personal sensing systems and applications. Our study results show that users are concerned that their sensed data can be misused, used for personal identification and tracking or for commercial purposes. However, they are willing to trade privacy for additional benefits if their sensed information is used for effective and beneficial causes. Furthermore, they are willing to trust reputed technology companies, with their data, if the benefits are significant. Based on these results, we propose a few design guidelines for designers of personal sensing apps and outline some interesting directions for future research.","","Detection,Privacy,Smartphones,Technology: Comprehensive Works","",""

One solution that has gained support in recent years among policy makers is Privacy by Design (PbD). The idea is simple: think of privacy ex ante, and embed privacy within the design of a new technological system, rather than try to fix it ex post, when it is often too late. However, PbD is yet to gain an active role in engineering practices. Thus far, there are only a few success stories. This article argues that a major obstacle for PbD is the discursive and conceptual gap between law and technology. A better diagnosis of the gaps between the legal and technological perceptions of privacy is a crucial step in seeking viable solutions. We juxtapose the two fields by reading each field in terms of the other: (1) by reverse engineering the law to expose its hidden assumptions about technology (the law's technological mindset), and (2) by reading canonical technological texts to expose their hidden assumptions about privacy (technology's privacy mindset). This article's focus is on one set of informational privacy practices: the large corporation that collects data from individual data subjects. This dual reverse engineering exercise indicates substantial gaps between the legal perception of informational privacy, as reflected in the set of principles commonly known as Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) and the perceptions of the engineering community.

Big data defies this linear logic, in that it decontextualizes data from its original environment and conducts an algorithmic nonlinear mix, match, and mine analysis. Applying data protection law to the processing of big data does not work well, to say the least.This Article examines the case of big medical data. A survey of emerging research practices indicates that studies either ignore data protection law altogether or assume an ex post position, namely that because they are conducted after the data has already been created in the course of providing medical care, and they use de-identified data, they go under the radar of data protection law. These studies focus on the end-point of the lifecycle of big data: if sufficiently anonymous at publication, the previous steps are overlooked, on the claim that they enjoy immunity. I argue that this answer is too crude. To portray data protection law in its best light, we should view it as a process-based attempt to equip data subjects with some power to control personal data about them, in all phases of data processing.Such control reflects the underlying justification of data protection law as an implementation of human dignity. The process-based approach fits current legal practices and is justified by reflecting dignitarian conceptions of informational privacy.","","44511:Supermarkets and Other Grocery (except Conve,Big Data,Indictments,Law,Supermarkets","",""

However, some analysts argue that these practices have the potential to invade applicants' privacy because they gather personal data that were originally intended for family and friends, or collect information that is not job related (e.g., off duty behavior, membership in protected classes) ( Gross {\&} Acquisti, 2005 ;  Tabibi, 2012 ). Despite the growing use of SNS data in the selection process, little theory or research has examined applicants' reactions to these practices. Thus, we used a model of privacy ( Stone {\&} Stone, 1990 ) to explain the factors that affect applicants' perceptions of invasion of privacy when SNS data are used in the hiring process. We also made minor additions to the model to fit the SNS context. The privacy model suggests that several information, procedural, sociocultural, and individual factors influence applicants' reactions, and we offer hypotheses based on the model to guide future research. We also consider the implications for establishing fair information policies, and balancing the needs of the organization for information against applicants' rights to privacy.","","Business And Economics--Labor And Industrial Relations,Employers,Human resources,Social networks","",""

Because there was "no 'causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,'" the Heart Center has not established traceability.125 The court explained that although the faxes did not technically have the requisite opt-out notice, the notice still sufficiently conveyed to recipients the means and opportunity to opt-out of receiving future faxes.126 Thus, the court concluded that the technical violation in the opt-out notices did not cause actual harm or create a risk of real harm.127 III.

Intended to provide a counter to the cheerleading and a framework for more balanced consideration of public cloud services, in particular, it begins with an exercise in accentuating the negative. In particular, it lays out various ways in which the cloud might be seen as a new platform for malice. The paper enumerates key issues, including kinds and sources of risk (vulnerabilities and threats) associated with providers and/or users and implications for trustworthiness in cloud contexts, as well as the prospects for new technology to counteract apparent sources of risk. It addresses different cloud contexts, and it argues for leveraging cloud concerns to rethink fundamental issues about the nature, handling, and protection of data (which may be stored or processed in the cloud - or not).

IoT devices include once everyday objects that are now internet connected, such as smart locks and smart fridges, but also new types of devices to include home assistants. However, while this increased interconnectivity brings considerable benefits, it can and does increase people's exposure to crime risk. This is particularly the case as most devices are developed without security in mind. One reason for this is that there is little incentive for manufacturers to make devices secure by design, and the costs of so doing do not encourage it. The principle aim of the current paper was to estimate the extent to which consumers are willing to pay for improved security in internet connected products. The second aim was to examine whether this is conditioned by their exposure to security-related information. Using an experimental design, and a contingent valuation method, we find that people are willing to pay for improved security and that for some devices, this increases if they are exposed to information about security prior to stating their willingness to pay. The implications of our findings for industry and the secure by design agenda are discussed.","","Crime,Criminology And Law Enforcement,Internet of Things,Network security,Priming,Risk,Security,Willingness to pay","",""

The distributed    amount of data is constantly growing in everyday life including    sensitive user's personal data. The amount of personal data in the    comparison to the data flowing thru the communication lines daily may    appear insignificant. However, every stored byte of personal data has    the same importance as any other streams of data on the public or    enterprise networks. The importance of person's data is too often    underestimated and therefore handled without sufficient care. The    awareness of data value and its underestimated data protection emerges    immediately after data loss or data inaccessibility occurs. Data loss    can happen in many different ways like careless handling of storage    media or devices, hardware failure, ransomware etc. The most often    appearing reason is accidental deletion of important files or    overwriting the existing ones. We understand the term careless handling    as keeping the data on single media without backup or using unreliable    media like USB flash drives. According to the researches, the USB flash    drives are the least appropriate media for data storage or protection    due to their notorious unreliability and proneness to mechanical or    electrical failures. However, making data backup on the USB flash drives    is still very popular among the users despite of many accidental data    loses. Irrespective from the way of losing data the importance of    reliable backups is obvious. Unfortunately, the attitude toward reliable    data protection is unsatisfying, sporadic or even not existing. Losing    of data can be very inconvenient or disastrous for students or    professional teachers. Especially in teacher's profession, it is very    important to keep different data secured from unauthorized access or    accidental loss. The aim of the surveys among the students ( future    teachers) is to discover the habits in securing data. The gathered    results show that the understanding of the importance of data backup    among students is very low. The students ( future teachers) are very    careless about securing their data. About 45 \% of students do not    create any backups of their files. Around the third of the students,    create backups only a few times in a year. Monthly backups are rather    occasional appearances, only handful of students create regular backups.    We have followed the trends thru the period of last three years and we    could not see any significant shift toward better and reliable data    protection. The attitude is the same for all the students and we could    not find any differences dependent on the study. In general, students    use two backup media: ( 1) USB Flash drive, and ( 2) the external hard    drive. Some students use the PCs secondary hard disk as the backup    destination. The students in our survey have acknowledged at least one    event of data loss in certain period. Despite of losing data the    student's general opinion is that data losses occur too rare to care    about the backups. Some of the students protect only the crucial data    and just a few students have established the reliable system for data    protection. The results of our research are perfect guidelines by    modifying of the learning contents at the study course of ICT in the    Education.

Today, billions of electronic devices and sensors collect, store, and analyze personal information from how fast we drive, to how fast our hearts beat, to how much and what we watch on TV. Even children provide billions of bits of personal information to the cloud through "smart" toys that capture images, recognize voices, and more. The unprecedented and unbridled new information flow generated from the little things of the IoT is creating big challenges for privacy regulators. Traditional regulators are armed with conventional tools not fully capable of handling the privacy challenges of the IoT. A critical review of recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement decisions sheds light on a recommended path for the future regulation of the IoT. This Article first examines the pervasiveness of the IoT and the data it collects in order to clarify the challenges facing regulators. It also highlights traditional privacy laws, principles, and regulations and explains why those rules do not fit the novel challenges and issues resulting from the IoT. Then it presents an in-depth analysis of four key FTC enforcement decisions to highlight how the FTC has and can regulate the IoT without undermining the innovation and benefits that this technology-and the data it provides- brings to our society. Specifically, the Article describes how the FTC, faced with the privacy challenge that accompanies the interconnected world of the IoT, has managed to apply traditional standards of "unfairness" and "deceptive practices" to protect private information. The FTC has been flexible and nimble with its interpretations of such standards and, in its most recent IoT case, FTC v. VIZIO, established a new "tool" in its toolkit for regulating IoT devices: an "unfair tracking" standard. As the de facto data protection authority in the United States, the FTC can use this new tool to work toward standardizing its treatment of IoT privacy issues instead of trying to fit those concerns neatly under the deception authority of section 5 of the FTC Act. However, this new tool also means that the FTC has the opportunity-and responsibility-to provide guidance on how it will wield that authority. To assure that innovation is not stifled and that this new rule is fairly applied (whether by the FTC or other agencies that may follow suit), it is imperative that the FTC diligently address concerns about the scope of this new rule and communicate that guidance to businesses, other regulators, and consumers alike. The new FTC administration should, as the primary regulator of information privacy and the IoT, continue the strong practice established by the previous administration, which is to provide guidance to businesses, consumers, and other regulators navigating the big challenges caused by the little things in the IoT.","","Automation,Computer privacy,Consumer protection,Consumers,Enforcement,Internet access,Internet of Things,Law,Personal information,Wireless access points","",""

The Court's interpretation of this notion had a considerable impact not only jon perception of the essence in other fields of law, but also on the constitutional doctrine more generally. This Article focuses on specificities of the notion of essence of fundamental rights to privacy and the protection of personal data from Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. After a general analysis, situating this notion into the framework of multi-level protection of fundamental rights in Europe, the Article addresses further interpretative challenges relating to the essence in the Court's case law. At the core of the analysis are the Schrems and Digital Rights Ireland cases, where the CJEU developed, for the first time, the modalities of the breach of essence of fundamental rights to privacy and data protection and laid down constitutional foundations for interpretation of this notion. Further jurisprudence, including the Tele2 Sverige and Opinion 1/15 cases, is analyzed as an example of fine-tuning of the CJEU's approach towards the normative understanding of this concept. Against this backdrop, the Article elaborates on the importance of insights in the fields of privacy and data protection for the general constitutional understanding of the concept of essence and proposes a generalized method for determination of infringement of essence in fundamental rights jurisprudence.","","Articles,Case law,Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU,Charters,Constitution,Constitutional law,Constitutions,Courts,Data,Data protection,Essence of fundamental rights,First time,Germany,Human rights,Infringement,Jurisprudence,Law,Privacy,Right of privacy,Schrems case,data protection,privacy","",""

This was how Internet Service Providers' communications records were accessed by police before specific statutory provision was made in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). Sections 28-29 of the Data Protection Act 1998 allow such voluntary arrangements for purposes related to national security, law enforcement, and taxation. Companies such as Facebook and RIM/BlackBerry have publicly acknowledged that they provide access to specific user data when UK public authorities follow the RIPA procedures, even though they are not legally required to. UK ISPs must retain records about their customers' Internet sessions and e-mail, although not message contents, under the Data Retention Regulations 2009. The government continues to discuss new legal powers that would require ISPs to store records relating to their customers' communications on webmail, social media, and other sites, which could then be accessed on a semi-automated but particularized basis under RIPA. It is likely that for national security purposes the government's signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, undertakes large-scale surveillance of Internet data transfers to or from points outside the UK. This can be authorized under RIPA, and telecommunications providers required to facilitate interception under that Act and the Telecommunications Act 1984. Under the UK/USA agreement GCHQ cooperates extremely closely with intelligence agencies in the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. It is likely that any access these agencies have to private-sector data will be shared to some extent.

The interdisciplinary approach is a unique feature and guarantees important new insights in the social, ethical and legal implications of these technologies for the individual and society as a whole. Its aim is to shed light on the tension between secrecy and transparency in the digital era. A special focus is put from the perspectives of psychology, medical ethics and European law on the contradiction between individuals' motivations for consented processing of personal data and their fears about unknown disclosure, transferal and sharing of personal data via information and communication technologies (named the "privacy paradox"). Potential benefits and harms for the individual and society resulting from the use of computers, mobile phones, the Internet and social media are being discussed. Furthermore, the authors point out the ethical and legal limitations inherent to the processing of personal data in a democratic society governed by the rule of law. Finally, they seek to demonstrate that the impact of information and communication technology use on the individuals' well-being, the latter being closely correlated with a high level of fundamental rights protection in Europe, is a promising feature of the socalled "e-democracy" as a new way to collectively attribute meaning to large-scale online actions, motivations and ideas.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","","Computer privacy,Data integrity,Ethics,Information technology,Philosophy","",""

Large volumes of personal and corporate data are being leaked via these breaches. The corporate responses to these breaches, as well as, the remediation of these breaches are often not sufficient. Similarly to how production companies should be taken to task for polluting the physical environment due to bad business practises, IT institutions should be made aware of their contribution to Cyber pollution. In our article we define the concept of cyber pollution as unmaintained or obsolete devices connect to the internet and corporate networks. This paper breaks down the current state of data breach disclosures within the Europe by providing statistics on large scale data breach disclosures from 2013 till 2016. This paper attempts to model the increase of threat exposure over time similar to that of pollution breaches within the physical environment. Over time small openings or vulnerabilities within systems can lead to exploitation of whole systems. By modelling these breaches as pollution we aim to make the concept of cyber pollution a more tangible concept for IT managers to relay to staffand upper management. The model is validated using anonymised corporate network traffic and Open Source penetration testing software.","","Citizenship,Communications traffic,Computers--Computer Security,Data integrity,Europe,Identity theft,Internet access,Internet of Things,Network security,Personal information,Pollution,Studies,Traffic models","",""

Three rounds moved participants toward consensus for solutions to counteract social engineering attacks in organizations.FindingsThree significant issues: compromised data; ineffective practices; and lack of ongoing education produced three target areas for implementing best practices in countering social engineering attacks. The findings offer counteractions by including education, policies, processes and continuous training in security practices.Research limitations/implicationsStudy limitations include lack of prior data on effective social engineering defense. Research implications stem from the psychology of human deception and trust with the ability to detect deception.Practical implicationsPractical implications relate to human judgment in complying with effective security policies and programs and consistent education and training. Future research may include exploring financial, operational and educational costs of implementing social engineering solutions.Social implicationsSocial implications apply across all knowledge workers who benefit from technology and are trusted to protect organizational assets and intellectual property.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the field of cybersecurity with a focus on trust and human deception to investigate solutions to counter social engineering attacks. This paper adds to under-represented cybersecurity research regarding effective implementation for social engineering defense.","","Best practice,Computer security,Data integrity,Deception,Decision making,Education,Employees,Engineering,Experts,Human–computer interaction (HCI),IT strategy,Infrastructure,Intellectual property,Internet crime,Judgments,Library And Information Sciences--Computer Applica,Organizations,Phishing,Policies,Psychology,Security,Security management,Technology,Training,Trust,United States--US","",""

Nevertheless, data breaches continue to occur. The purpose of this paper is to offer new insight into the causes of such breaches, thus paving the way for novel approaches to privacy protection. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a semiotic framework identifying the data, task related and normative factors that influence behaviour. A qualitative study with branch and back office employees in a British financial institution illustrates the explanatory value of the framework. Findings - The results show that the legal tools provide guidance only when they are clear, relevant and enforceable, that technology reduces idiosyncrasy but has limited application and, crucially, that employees' attitudes, group norms, preconceptions and mental processes dramatically condition behaviour. Research limitations/implications - The study integrates the limited marketing literature available on the reasons for privacy breaches, and advances the understanding of the role of employees in safeguarding customer data. It is an exploratory, small-scale study that simultaneously offers new insight and identifies areas where further research is needed. Practical implications - The paper presents practical contributions to marketing managers concerning policy wording, job design and reward schemes. Originality/value - The study delivers a holistic framework to assess how the various privacy related initiatives may interact with each other, and specifically focusing the researcher's attention on what is often the weakest link in privacy protection: staff.

However, in the digitally connected world the organisation is increasingly challenged to protect personal data and there is greater potential for inappropriate data use or disclosure, which can result in legal, financial, and reputational consequences for the organisation. Developments brought about by digital transformation increase the requirement for more stringent approaches to personal data protection to be implemented by the organisation. In most countries, data protection is taken very seriously and enforced through strict regulations (e.g. GDPR) which every organisation who holds personal data must adhere to. However, high-profile data breaches continue to occur. Research suggests that data protection controls have not kept pace with the degree to which organisations are experimenting with digital technologies and the unprecedented data volumes. Many organisations are unable to detect when or where their data systems have been breached. In order to comply with regulatory requirements to protect personal data and avoid potentially significant legal, financial, and reputational implications of a data breach, many organisations must improve their personal data protection approaches. This paper presents the key components or 'capability building blocks' of a conceptual framework in the area of Personal Data Protection (PDP) within the organisational context. This framework was developed based on the findings or themes that emerged from a systematic literature review (SLR) in this area followed by an open innovation approach. The resultant conceptual framework can be used by organisations to undertake a holistic analysis of their personal data protection capability. The framework also includes a set of POMs (Practices, Outcomes and Metrics) which acts as a roadmap for organisations to improve upon their current level of maturity in this area to effectively protect personal data and to demonstrate that the organisation is a trustworthy data custodian.","","Compliance,Computer privacy,Computer security,Computers--Computer Security,Councils,Data integrity,Data systems,Decision making,Europe,Fines {\&} penalties,General Data Protection Regulation,Information sharing,Literature reviews,Organizational aspects,Parliaments,Trends,Trustworthiness","",""

The EU is not an exception in this context, given its rapidly developing cyber security policy. Since the 1990s, we could observe the creation of three broad areas of policy interest: cyber-crime, critical information infrastructures and cyber-defence. One of the main trends transversal to these areas is the importance that the private sector has come to assume within them. In particular in the area of critical information infrastructure protection, the private sector is seen as a key stakeholder, given that it currently operates most infrastructures in this area. As a result of this operative capacity, the private sector has come to be understood as the expert in network and information systems security, whose knowledge is crucial for the regulation of the field. Adopting a Regulatory Capitalism framework, complemented by insights from Network Governance, we can identify the shifting role of the private sector in this field from one of a victim in need of protection in the first phase, to a commercial actor bearing responsibility for ensuring network resilience in the second, to an active policy shaper in the third, participating in the regulation of NIS by providing technical expertise. By drawing insights from the above-mentioned frameworks, we can better understand how private actors are involved in shaping regulatory responses, as well as why they have been incorporated into these regulatory networks.","","2147:social problems and social welfare; sociology of crime,9141:political economy; political economy,9263:public policy/administration; public administration/bureaucracy,Capitalism,Computer security,Crete,Crime,Criminal statistics,Criminology And Law Enforcement,Empowerment,Europe,Governance,Information systems,Information technology,Infrastructure,Internet,Liberalization,Network governance,Network information security,Policy networks,Private sector,Privatization,Protection,Regulation,Regulatory capitalism,Resilience,Security,Security policy,United Kingdom--UK","",""

The model posits that seven factors - perceived internet privacy risk, collection, error, secondary use, improper access, reputation, and third party certificate - have a significant impact on CFIP.

These purposes range from battling crime and terrorism to assessing public policy initiatives and enforcing regulatory regimes. To aid these efforts, governments are promoting mandatory retention and reporting of data by online service providers and the expansion of laws that facilitate wiretaps to greater portions of the web. The legal framework for protecting individual privacy within this growing world of big data is patchy and in critical ways outdated. Most of the current framework was erected in response to pronouncements by the Supreme Court over the years regarding the scope of constitutional privacy protections. Widespread agreement over the need for legislators to update the statutory regime has not yet produced results. Against this backdrop, the US Supreme Court has struggled in recent cases to articulate workable constitutional and statutory privacy norms that can help guide government, and individuals, in a world of digital and distributed data. An examination of the Court's privacy jurisprudence over the past forty years offers a number of insights into how the Court, and policy-makers, may achieve a balance between privacy and data use that accords with constitutional norms, serves vital public policy goals, and secures greater public trust and support.","","1210:Politics {\&} political behavior,4330:Litigation,5220:Information technology management,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9190:United States,Cloud computing,Law,Regulation,Right of privacy,Studies,Supreme Court decisions,Surveillance of citizens,United States--US","",""

In this paper I focus upon elucidating the idea of balance in intellectual property and propose that the balance concept is not only the most feasible way to examine whether past solutions to copyright problems are fair, but it also provides the ability to predict what will be the better solution for all affected parties. Based upon an envy-free contribution towards predicting the efficient balance, game theory is applied in a novel manner to the DRM problem to infer where and what might be the optimal balance in the debate over the nature of access right.

Sub-cultures have significant impact on the perceptions. Political systems, history, and legal environment may also play a role in the differences of PAPA perceptions among the three Chinese societies. The study also revealed that accuracy and intellectual property are the most deficient areas of moral developments in both Chinese and American samples.Research limitations/implicationsThe sample sizes from Hong Kong and the USA were relatively small due to resource and time constraints.

Huge data breaches fill our headlines. Companies often violate their own privacy policies by selling customer data, or by using the information in ways that fall outside their policy. Yet, even when there is indisputable misconduct, the law generally does not hold these companies accountable. That is because traditional legal claims are poorly suited for handling privacy losses. Contract claims fail when privacy policies are not considered contractual obligations. Misrepresentation claims cannot succeed when customers never read and rely on those policies. The economic loss rule thwarts many negligence claims. But undoubtedly the thorniest obstacle is that privacy harms are often not considered cognizable injuries under many common legal theories. Tort, contract, and constitutional standing doctrine all demand some form of concrete injury, but privacy injuries are often too intangible or risk-based to qualify. Thus, no matter how blatantly a company violates its privacy obligations or how porous a company's data security is, the victims' lawsuit is often perfunctorily dismissed. While many commentators have persuasively argued that we should modify these doctrines to better accommodate privacy harms, this Article takes a different tack and revives an old, neglected common law approach to address these modern ills. Privacy victims should use the oft-misunderstood law of restitution and unjust enrichment to disgorge the wrongful gains companies earn when they break their privacy policies. This theory also will allow victims to recover any wrongful savings companies retain when they fail to take reasonable data security precautions and instead use deficient cybersecurity. Because unjust enrichment focuses on the defendant's wrongful gain and not the plaintiffs injury, this theory can avoid many of the pitfalls associated with the more conventional causes of action privacy plaintiffs typically raise.","","Data integrity,Law,Privacy,State court decisions,Torts","",""

Design/methodology/approach – Building upon social exchange theory and privacy calculus theory, an integrated model was developed. The model was tested empirically using a sample of 405 social networking site's users. Users were required to complete a survey regarding self-disclosure behaviors in Facebook. Findings – The results indicate that social influence is the factor which exhibits the strongest effect on self-disclosure in social networking sites, followed by perceived benefits. Surprisingly, perceived privacy risk does not have any significant impact on self-disclosure. Research limitations/implications – The results inform researchers about the importance to incorporate social influence factors and cultural factors into future online self-disclosure study. Practical implications – The results suggest that users focus on the benefits as well as social influence when they decide to reveal personal information in social networking sites, but pay less attention to the potential privacy risks. Educators are advised to launch educational programs to raise students' awareness to the potential risks of self-disclosure in social networking sites. Service providers of social networking sites are encouraged to provide intuitive privacy indices showing users the levels of privacy protection.

The Open Data movement is considered one of the keys to this change. To the best of our knowledge, the current generation of Open Data has to date provided only static datasets in which no data concerning specific individuals could be included, due to obvious privacy issues. Public administrations hold a great deal of data of a personal kind, as do many private entities. Consider, for instance, the huge amount of personal data contributed to the various online social networks, or the electricity consumption data collected and stored by energy providers, or the telephone and internet data collected by telecommunications companies. The lack of such personal data in the Open Data realm, and the static nature of the released datasets, are weaknesses of the current generation of Open Data. Without personal data and without timeliness, it is impossible to build useful services tailored to the actual needs of a given individual at a given time. We argue that, by segregating or "protecting" our personal data, those public and private entities become the "owners" of our data. This means they hold a monopoly on services, while we, the legitimate owners of the data, must abide by their terms and conditions concerning how our data are treated and used. By unleashing personal data "into the wild", such a monopoly would collapse and a new ecosystem of personal services based on these data could flourish. Of course nobody wants personal data to enter the public domain without any control. We argue that an appropriate policy for online disclosure of personal data is one where the individuals are restored to their role of "data owners" and are allowed to exert online control over data accesses being performed by third parties. This idea of "smart disclosure" of personal data is expected to be one of the forthcoming evolutions of Open Data. Based on the above arguments, we propose a possible implementation of "smart disclosure" that takes advantage of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. If properly implemented, OAuth 2.0 guarantees access to selected personal data upon authorization by the individual data owner. An implementation is presented together with possible use cases.

Effective privacy policies are crucial in an environment where digital accumulation of vast amounts of information can lead to digital dossiers on so many people.

The public availability of spatial data on countries' conservation estates is important for broad-scale conservation planning and monitoring and for evaluating progress towards targets. Yet there has been limited consideration of how PPA data is reported to national and international protected area databases, particularly whether such reporting is transparent and fair (i.e., equitable) to the landholders involved. Here we consider PPA reporting procedures from three countries with high numbers of PPAs—Australia, South Africa, and the United States—illustrating the diversity within and between countries regarding what data is reported and the transparency with which it is reported. Noting a potential tension between landholder preferences for privacy and security of their property information and the benefit of sharing this information for broader conservation efforts, we identify the need to consider equity in PPA reporting processes. Unpacking potential considerations and tensions into distributional, procedural, and recognitional dimensions of equity, we propose a series of broad principles to foster transparent and fair reporting. Our approach for navigating the complexity and context-dependency of equity considerations will help strengthen PPA reporting and facilitate the transparent integration of PPAs into broader conservation efforts.","","Aichi Target 11,Australia,Biodiversity,Collaboration,Computer security,Conservation,Convention on Biological Diversity,Data bases,Databases,Dependence,Endangered {\&} extinct species,Environmental science,Environmental stewardship,Equity,Land conservation,Mexico,Planning,Private property,Protected areas,Reporting,Research,Security,South Africa,Spatial data,St Lucia,Transparency,United Kingdom--UK,United States--US,conservation planning,equity framework,privacy,private land conservation,protected area reporting","",""

Despite the fact that this principle is often referred to as a key tenet of the data protection framework, a precise understanding of its role remains elusive. As such, this article aims to provide the first steps towards a more thorough understanding of the fairness principle. This is significant as it is argued that fairness is delineated from the other data protection principles and thus this article aims to clarify its overarching role and importance in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The article divides the fairness principle into procedural fairness and fair balancing elements which are evident in the fairness checks and balances in the GDPR. Building on this analysis the article identifies gaps, shortcomings and areas for future research thus calling for further analysis on the precise contours of the fairness principle.","","Europe,General Data Protection Regulation,Law--International Law,Principles","",""

It is a departure from studying cultural variables at the individual level. We also identify the cultural impact of legislation at the national level. Previous models generally use a relatively crude division of legislative codes. By contrast, this work examines the impact of culture on baskets of privacy elements drawn from the EU directive. These attributes are candidates for codification in law, but are taken up at varying rates. A key originality and challenge of the work is the use of the GLOBE variables for culture. Results suggest that group collectivism, power distance, assertiveness and uncertainty avoidance are the most powerful cultural predictors of the level of privacy legislation provision.","","1220:Social trends {\&} culture,4310:Regulation,5220:Information technology management,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9175:Western Europe,Business And Economics--Computer Applications,Collectivism,Culture,EU directives,Europe,Free trade,GLOBE Variables,Information privacy,Information systems,Information technology,M15,M38,National culture,Privacy,Studies","",""

The significance of these results is considered within the enforcement and victimisation policy context that surrounds computer misuse and fraud. It is argued that while Action Fraud data provides a rich source of data with respect to victims' needs, specific improvements in data collection and processing could aid local forces in the delivery (or facilitation) of a more victim-focused response. Alongside this, the results highlight how an adequate police response must take victim heterogeneity into account, both at national and local levels. Finally, better understandings of vulnerability (both theoretically informed and empirically tested) are necessary, on which to build an adequate victim-response to these crime types.","","Computer misuse,Criminology And Law Enforcement,Cybercrime,Fraud,Internet crime,Law enforcement,Online crime,Police,Policing,Repeat victims,United Kingdom--UK,Victimisation,Victimization,Vulnerability,Wales","",""

It is argued that it is important to understand individuals' privacy values with respect to cloud computing to define cloud privacy objectives.Design/methodology/approachFor the purpose of this study, the authors adopted Keeney's (1994) value-focused thinking approach to identify privacy objectives with respect to cloud computing.FindingsThe results of this study identified the following six fundamental cloud privacy objectives: to increase trust with cloud provider, to maximize identity management controls, to maximize responsibility of information stewardship, to maximize individual's understanding of cloud service functionality, to maximize protection of rights to privacy, and to maintain the integrity of data.Research limitations/implicationsOne limitation is generalizability of the cloud privacy objectives, and the second is research bias. As this study focused on cloud privacy, the authors felt that the research participants' increased knowledge of technology usage, including that of cloud technology, was a benefit that outweighed risks associated with not having a random selection of the general population. The newness and unique qualities of privacy issues in cloud computing are better fitted to a qualitative study where issues can emerge naturally through a holistic approach opposed to trying to force fit an existing set of variables or constructs into the context of privacy and cloud computing.Practical implicationsThe findings of this research study can be used to assist management in the process of formulating a cloud privacy policy, develop cloud privacy evaluation criteria as well as assist auditors in developing their privacy audit work plans.Originality/valueCurrently, there is little to no guidance in the literature or in practice as to what organizations need to do to ensure they protect their stakeholders privacy in a cloud computing environment.

Moreover, different online social media and blogosphere are bringing people together, providing platforms to share their ideas and allowing their voices to be heard. Ideally, the cyberspace has no political, geographical or social boundaries; as a result it is promoting globalization and uniting people from all over the world. While the potential benefits of this interconnectivity are unlimited, this virtual world is also becoming hackers' playground, underworld's marketplace, nation-states' battle ground, and a vehicle for propaganda and misinformation. In this paper, we argue that with the growing threat of coordinated attacks, release of complex malware and gradually diminished trust in freely-available Information, the openness of the web and its global connectivity will no longer exist. Specifically, if this trend continues, the Internet will be partitioned, users will rely on information and news only through membership-based services, the information flow will be limited to geographical and political jurisdictions and will be highly regulated by governments, online businesses and critical knowledge will only be shared among alliance of friendly nations.","","Computer security,Computer viruses,Computers--Computer Security,Customer services,Data encryption,Espionage,Identity theft,Intellectual property,Internet crime,Internet service providers,Trust","",""

Last updated - 2020-08-04","The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly changing our society to a world where every “thing” is connected to the Internet, making computing pervasive like never before. This tsunami of connectivity and data collection relies more and more on the Cloud, where data analytics and intelligence actually reside. Cloud computing has indeed revolutionized the way computational resources and services can be used and accessed, implementing the concept of utility computing whose advantages are undeniable for every business. However, despite the benefits in terms of flexibility, economic savings, and support of new services, its widespread adoption is hindered by the security issues arising with its usage. From a security perspective, the technological revolution introduced by IoT and Cloud computing can represent a disaster, as each object might become inherently remotely hackable and, as a consequence, controllable by malicious actors. While the literature mostly focuses on the security of IoT and Cloud computing as separate entities, in this article we provide an up-to-date and well-structured survey of the security issues of cloud computing in the IoT era. We give a clear picture of where security issues occur and what their potential impact is. As a result, we claim that it is not enough to secure IoT devices, as cyber-storms come from Clouds.","","Architecture,Classification,Cloud computing,Computers--Internet,Confidentiality,Data collection,Internet of Things,Research,Security,Security management,Software services,Storms,security","",""

Ease of use, mobility and the absence of globally accepted standard data access/security protocols make the mobile cloud susceptible to different types of attacks. The advent of smartphones and the widespread use of other mobile devices such as tablets have introduced a new dimension to cloud computing, offering a higher degree of flexibility in data access, and with it has increased the need for security standards. Unlike other issues, security and privacy are crucial when associated with business requirements, financial transactions, and health care. Studies indicate that existing cloud services can suffer from numerous security and privacy issues, such as MITM (man-in-the-middle), DDoS (distributed denial of service), data theft, data compatibility, and information leakage. The objective of this paper is three-fold. Firstly, we highlight the importance of security and privacy issues in cloud computing in general, and in mobile cloud computing in particular and survey the literature in this area. Secondly, we outline and discuss four strategies, namely, refined policy, compatible software and interfaces, authentication and security audit, as means to mitigate threats to the mobile cloud platform.

An empirical model was tested using LISREL structural equation modeling and multigroup analysis. The results support the hypotheses with regard to direction and relative magnitude of the relationships. Italians exhibit lower Internet privacy concerns than individuals in the U.S., lower perceived need for government surveillance, and higher concerns about government intrusion.

The current understanding of privacy is largely fragmented and discipline-dependent. This study develops and tests a framework of information privacy and its correlates, the latter often being confused with or built into definitions of information privacy per se. Our framework development was based on the privacy theories of Westin and Altman, the economic view of the privacy calculus, and the identity management framework of Zwick and Dholakia. The dependent variable of the model is perceived information privacy. The particularly relevant correlates to information privacy are anonymity, secrecy, confidentiality, and control. We posit that the first three are tactics for information control; perceived information control and perceived risk are salient determinants of perceived information privacy; and perceived risk is a function of perceived benefits of information disclosure, information sensitivity, importance of information transparency, and regulatory expectations. The research model was empirically tested and validated in the Web 2.0 context, using a survey of Web 2.0 users. Our study enhances the theoretical understanding of information privacy and is useful for privacy advocates, and legal, management information systems, marketing, and social science scholars.

These facts inevitably affect the perception of privacy and raise the question of whether privacy is dead or takes the last breath in the digital age? This paper is an attempt to address this question.   Design/Methodology/Approach - Based on the comparison and systematic analysis of scientific literature, the authors discuss problematic issues related to privacy and data protection in the technology era - where these issues are too complicated to be clearly regulated by laws and rules since "laws move as a function of years and technology moves as a function of months" (Ron Rivest). Therefore, this analytical approach towards the issue may help to facilitate reaching the best-fit decision in this area.   Findings - The authors emphasize the change of perception of privacy, which originated and grew on the idea of "an integral part of our humanity", the "heart of our liberty" and "the beginning of all freedoms" (Solove, 2008), leading to the recently raised idea that privacy is severely hanging with threat. The authors are of the opinion that legislation and regulation may be one of the best and effective techniques for protecting privacy in the twenty-first century, but it is not currently adequate (Wacks, 2012). One of the solutions lies in technology design.   Research limitations/implications - The aspects of privacy and data protection in the European Union have been widely discussed recently because of their broad applicability. Therefore, it is hardly possible to review and cover all the important aspects of the issue. This article focuses on the roles of technology and legislation in securing privacy. The authors examine and provide their own views based on the critical analysis of the outstanding scientific material.   Practical implications - The authors highlight the ongoing change of perception of privacy. If regulation is left behind the development of technology, privacy will hardly stay alive. On the other hand, if legislation is applied on an ex-ante basis, technological development will depend on the legislators. The balance of both may be the golden means and it basically depends on the coordinated behavior of all the stakeholders.   Value - The article emphasizes that the rising role of sharp development of technology by itself does not violate privacy. It is the people using this technology and the policies they carry out that create violations (Garfinkel, 2000). In fact, threats, in the first instance, are the consequences of human behavior. In other words, technology can be a significant factor of violating or demolishing privacy, however, it may also be the major method of protecting it. The balance of both may be the key means.

An important prerequisite for the penetration and widespread use of Information Society technologies is to enhance the perception of security that these technologies offer without making them inaccessible to users with limited computational resources. In this paper a new algorithm for the software implementation of modular multiplication is proposed, which uses pre-computations with a constant modulus to reduce the computational load imposed upon the processor. The developed modular multiplication algorithm provides faster execution on low complexity hardware in comparison with the existing algorithms and is oriented towards the variable value of the modulus, especially with the software implementation on micro controllers and smart cards whose architectures include a small number of bits. The use of the new algorithm in Information Society applications that demand security is investigated. Such applications include e-Government, e-Banking, e-Commerce etc. The algorithm is shown to be adequate both for the applications for which it was originally intended, as well as for applications that are much more demanding in the level of security they require, such as military applications.

In addition, the EU lawmaker intends to adopt specific rules to protect confidentiality of communications, in a separate ePrivacy Regulation. Some have argued that there is no need for such additional rules for communications confidentiality.This Article discusses the protection of the right to confidentiality of communications in Europe. We look at the right's origins to assess the rationale for protecting it. We also analyze how the right is currently protected under the European Convention on Human Rights and under EU law.We show that at its core the right to communications confidentiality protects three individual and collective values: privacy, freedom of expression, and trust in communication services. The right aims to ensure that individuals and organizations can safely entrust communication to service providers. Initially, the right protected only postal letters, but it has gradually developed into a strong safeguard for the protection of confidentiality of communications, regardless of the technology used.Hence, the right does not merely serve individual privacy interests, but also other more collective interests that are crucial for the functioning of our information society. We conclude that separate EU rules to protect communications confidentiality, next to the GDPR, are justified and necessary.","","Confidentiality,Europe,General Data Protection Regulation,Law,Privacy","",""

The concern is due to several factors. First, Automatic License Plate Reader (ALPR) systems have proliferated throughout the country as law enforcement learns of its usefulness in crime interdiction. Second, the data collected are being aggregated in massive regional databases, raising the specter of location tracking. Third, there is a lack of uniform standards governing retention and use of ALPR data collected or accessed by government. Fourth, the collection and use of license plate data by private companies is growing rapidly in an unregulated environment, leading to concerns that the data may be abused or used for purposes other than as initially intended. Finally, there is a growing public awareness of the potential privacy dangers arising from geolocation tracking in light of (1) the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in United States V. Jones, which held that the warrantless installation of a GPS tracking device on a suspect's vehicle implicated Fourth Amendment protections and (2) a widely circulated national study by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raising the specter of massive government surveillance through the use of ALPR technology. ALPR technology respects no geographic boundaries, yet Congress has been reluctant to regulate or limit the technology. State legislatures, however, have begun to address the technology but are doing so without any consistent or principled legislative approach. The ALPR industry has vigorously lobbied against restrictive laws and has filed suits claiming various laws infringe upon First Amendment rights. As a consequence, we are heading toward an environment of piecemeal and inconsistent regulation that will be fertile ground for litigation for many years to come. The article identifies privacy issues and other legal risks associated with unregulated use of ALPR technology, offers a brief analysis of the potential First and Fourth Amendment issues implicated, surveys the current legislative attempts to regulate the technology, and proposes guiding principles that legislators should follow in drafting laws to regulate ALPR technology. The overarching objective of the principles is (1) to provide a rational and comprehensive framework in which to approach the regulation of the technology, and (2) to adequately address the principle privacy concern of most citizens-government suspicionless surveillance-without unduly hampering the effectiveness of law enforcement or negatively impacting the ALPR industry's core business of serving the financial and repossession industries. The enactment of laws is always an exercise in compromise, and the ten suggested principles are offered as a cogent path toward rational legislation.","","Arrest warrants,Departments,Education,Law enforcement,Legislation,License plates,Principles,Privacy,Public safety,Surveillance,Vehicles","",""

But the academic literature and public debate have not fully appreciated the extent to which the United States has already backed into a de facto system of "public-private cybersecurity." This system is characterized by the surprisingly important, quasi-governmental role of the private sector on key cybersecurity issues, and correspondingly by instances in which the federal government acts more like a market participant than a traditional regulator. The public-private cybersecurity system challenges scholarly approaches to privatization, which focus on maintaining public law values when government functions are contracted out to private parties. The informal and complicated structure of public-private relationships in cybersecurity renders concerns about public law values at once more serious and more difficult to remedy. This Article first explores the line between public and private functions and provides a descriptive account of the public-private cybersecurity system. It highlights the relative roles of the U.S. government and private sector in four important contexts related to international cybersecurity threats: (!) disrupting networks of infected computers used by transnational-criminal groups ("botnet takedowns"), (2) remediating software vulnerabilities that can be used for crime, espionage, and offensive operations ("zero-day vulnerabilities"), (3) attributing cyber intrusions to state-sponsored attackers, and (4) defending privately-owned systems and networks from sophisticated, nation-state-sponsored attackers. The Article then uses the public-private cybersecurity system to challenge and complicate existing scholarship on privatization. Procedurally, the public-private cybersecurity system differs from traditional privatization because private actors-not the government-decide what functions they should perform, and private actors operate outside of the contractual frameworks that have traditionally restrained private contractors. Substantively, the cybersecurity context implicates public law values addressed in prior work-including accountability, transparency, and due process or fairness-but it also raises additional concerns about security and privacy. Evaluating how the public-private cybersecurity system attains and falls short of public law values yields broader lessons for cybersecurity governance and for privatization. The public-private cybersecurity system shows that concerns about public law values are not unidirectional-sometimes threats to public values come from the government, not the private sector. On the other hand, while empowered private parties play a crucial role in cybersecurity and in many ways currently support public values, this alignment is a present fortuity, not a structural feature, and so may shift in the future, posing new threats to public law values. These complexities require new kinds of context-dependent solutions to safeguard public law values.

The purpose of this paper is to examine variables predicting anxiety about data hacking, and the role that such anxiety and other potentially important variables have in explaining the use of digital privacy protection behavior.Design/methodology/approachIn total, 305 participants from an online labor market were sampled who frequently use the internet, surveyed about recent anxiety (using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7)), anxiety about data hacking (GAD-7, in reference to data hacking), and issues of digital privacy: news exposure, perceived importance, self-efficacy, protection behavior, and previous hacking victimization.FindingsProfession (information technology-related) moderated the symptom structure for recent anxiety, but not data hacking anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, prior hacking victimization predicted anxiety about hacking. Digital privacy protection behavior was related to hacking anxiety and privacy self-efficacy. Data hacking anxiety mediated relations between hacking victimization and privacy protection. Privacy self-efficacy mediated relations between news exposure to hacking incidents and privacy protection.Research limitations/implicationsLimitations include the self-report nature of the instruments, and use of a selective, non-random sample.Practical implicationsResults highlight knowledge, self-efficacy, and threat appraisal among IT managers in motivating better digital security practices.Originality/valueThis is the first study using a standardized instrument of anxiety to examine distress about hacking and predictors of digital privacy protection behavior.","","14.13:COMPUTERS,33:Internet and Intranet Applications (CI),Anxiety,Computer privacy,Computer security,Computers--Internet,Consumer protection,Consumers,Data integrity,Digital technology,Information management,Mobile commerce,Personal information,Privacy,Smartphones,Social networks,Social research,United States--US,User behavior,Virtual private networks","",""

That's almost two deaths per second. Every day, 8000 Facebook members die-and Facebook is just one of many social networks. With four in five Internet users using social networks and blogs, many Internet users die leaving behind social networking accounts-arguably, significant parts of themselves. Who should decide what happens to these personal accounts? While some users have begun adding digital assets to wills, the current state of the law is not up to date or clear on whether social networking accounts are part of a deceased's estate. And what about those users without wills? Ninety-four percent of U.S. teens use Facebook, and few are likely to have seriously contemplated death, let alone have wills in place. To eliminate this gap and confusion in the law, Congress needs to implement a uniform solution addressing social media access after death. The courts, and ultimately social networking sites themselves, would be bound to those standards, thus eliminating confusion and the need for wills pertaining to social networks. Moreover, social networking accounts are made to be modified and accessed solely by the creator, and thus should be legally construed as extensions of the self, whereby individual property rights in such accounts are extinguished upon death and remain nontransferable.","","Agreements,Education,Families {\&} family life,Internet,Law,Privacy,Social networks,Wills","",""

One estimate is that 10 million customers are victims of identity theft each year. In fact, it is difficult to avoid news on public disclosure of security breaches to corporate databases that companies made in 2005. A typical example was the backup computer tape containing personal data for 3.9 million customers that was lost by the world's largest financial services company in transit by courier to a credit reporting bureau. Consumers are clearly alarmed and some are switching banks or changing their online behavior in order to protect their identity. As a result, there is increased pressure on organizations to improve data security and therefore provide customers with some assurance that their personal information will not be misappropriated. This paper discusses identity theft and the risk to consumers as well as current efforts by federal and state governments to protect the privacy of their constituents. It offers steps that could be taken by organizations to protect their most critical asset - customer information - against identity theft.

Examples include biometric and health-related data, such as fingerprint patterns, heart rates, and calories burned. This Article explores the connection between the types of data generated by the IoT and the financial frameworks of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the Bankruptcy Code. It critiques these regimes, which enable the commodification of consumer data, as well as laws aimed at protecting consumer data, such as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, various state biometric data statutes, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This Article contends that in addition to privacy policies, financial frameworks can also play a critical role in facilitating the transfer and disclosure of consumer data in a manner that is opaque and potentially harmful to consumers. Furthermore, existing privacy frameworks that rely heavily on a notice and choice model and the provisions of a company's privacy policy to determine the level of protection given to consumers, and which may not always apply to IoT companies, do not effectively safeguard consumers in the IoT setting. This Article proposes several solutions to engender movement away from an overreliance on the notice and choice model and the terms of privacy policies, and to reduce the various moments of data disclosure authorized by financial frameworks. It also offers ways to preserve the value of IoT data as a source of financing for companies while simultaneously protecting the privacy of consumers.","","Advertising,Bankruptcy,Bankruptcy reorganization,Big Data,Biometrics,Consumer protection,Consumers,Databases,Equity financing,Internet crime,Internet of Things,Law,Powell, Jerome,Privacy,Sales,Uniform Commercial Code-US,Venture capital","",""

If computer sciences and genetic technologies have established that anonymity is impossible to ensure in current times, why does the fiction of anonymity continue to survive in cryobanks? I argue that the performance and management of ‘anonymity' meet different needs of donors, recipients, and cryobanks. While absolute anonymity is neither possible nor preferable to cryobanks (as donor records may be needed for future medical and legal references), contractual anonymity gives the parties involved reassurance that the flow of information is under reliable control – in this case – the control of cryobanks. While complete protection of the donor's private information is limited in actuality, it provides a certain freedom from an unforeseen and undetermined future by temporarily easing donor and recipient apprehensions about feared ‘what-if' scenarios. In order to be useful, anonymity's mechanics must incorporate enough flexibility to be undone if needed.","","Anonymity,Computer science,Donors,Fiction,Flexibility,Freedoms,Genetics,Medicine,Protection,Reassurance,Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works,Sperm donations,United States--US,anonymity,cryobanks,identification,privacy","",""

The internet is today more than what they hoped it would become back then, in 1962 - „a galactic network". As studies show, there are more than 4.3 billion users around the world. It's more than a way of live for most of people, being used to communicate and get informed, to learn and teach others, to socialize, to play or work, to buy and sell things, to do business etc. Its future is already about the internet of things. But the internet came with a lot of risks and threats that the users, at any level, have to deal with. These threats originate in different types of hacking -from small cybercrimes, to cyber war, cyber terrorism or cyber espionage. Most of them target information - personal or secret data, both valuable to the potential victims. The cybersecurity culture concept is not only about the community or society level of knowledge related to security threats and risks, and the prevention ways valid in every case, but also how the individual can or must act in such a situation. In fewer words, the cybersecurity concept is about making the internet user both security receiver and provider.","","Blogs,Computer security,Culture,Data encryption,Electronic warfare,Espionage,Hackers,International organizations,Internet crime,Internet of Things,Military,National security,Romania,Terrorism","",""

As being a commonly accepted term for research centers and universities, the Industry 4.0 initiative has received a splendid attention of the business and research community. Although the idea is not new and was on the agenda of academic research in many years with different perceptions, the term “Industry 4.0” is just launched and well accepted to some extend not only in academic life but also in the industrial society as well. While academic research focuses on understanding and defining the concept and trying to develop related systems, business models and respective methodologies, industry, on the other hand, focuses its attention on the change of industrial machine suits and intelligent products as well as potential customers on this progress. It is therefore important for the companies to primarily understand the features and content of the Industry 4.0 for potential transformation from machine dominant manufacturing to digital manufacturing. In order to achieve a successful transformation, they should clearly review their positions and respective potentials against basic requirements set forward for Industry 4.0 standard. This will allow them to generate a well-defined road map. There has been several approaches and discussions going on along this line, a several road maps are already proposed. Some of those are reviewed in this paper. However, the literature clearly indicates the lack of respective assessment methodologies. Since the implementation and applications of related theorems and definitions outlined for the 4th industrial revolution is not mature enough for most of the reel life implementations, a systematic approach for making respective assessments and evaluations seems to be urgently required for those who are intending to speed this transformation up. It is now main responsibility of the research community to developed technological infrastructure with physical systems, management models, business models as well as some well-defined Industry 4.0 scenarios in order to make the life for the practitioners easy. It is estimated by the experts that the Industry 4.0 and related progress along this line will have an enormous effect on social life. As outlined in the introduction, some social transformation is also expected. It is assumed that the robots will be more dominant in manufacturing, implanted technologies, cooperating and coordinating machines, self-decision-making systems, autonom problem solvers, learning machines, 3D printing etc. will dominate the production process. Wearable internet, big data analysis, sensor based life, smart city implementations or similar applications will be the main concern of the community. This social transformation will naturally trigger the manufacturing society to improve their manufacturing suits to cope with the customer requirements and sustain competitive advantage. A summary of the potential progress along this line is reviewed in introduction of the paper. It is so obvious that the future manufacturing systems will have a different vision composed of products, intelligence, communications and information network. This will bring about new business models to be dominant in industrial life. Another important issue to take into account is that the time span of this so-called revolution will be so short triggering a continues transformation process to yield some new industrial areas to emerge. This clearly puts a big pressure on manufacturers to learn, understand, design and implement the transformation process. Since the main motivation for finding the best way to follow this transformation, a comprehensive literature review will generate a remarkable support. This paper presents such a review for highlighting the progress and aims to help improve the awareness on the best experiences. It is intended to provide a clear idea for those wishing to generate a road map for digitizing the respective manufacturing suits. By presenting this review it is also intended to provide a hands-on library of Industry 4.0 to both academics as well as industrial practitioners. The top 100 headings, abstracts and key words (i.e. a total of 619 publications of any kind) for each search term were independently analyzed in order to ensure the reliability of the review process. Note that, this exhaustive literature review provides a concrete definition of Industry 4.0 and defines its six design principles such as interoperability, virtualization, local, real-time talent, service orientation and modularity. It seems that these principles have taken the attention of the scientists to carry out more variety of research on the subject and to develop implementable and appropriate scenarios.

Existing technology acceptance theories mainly consider cognitive beliefs resulting in adoption behavior. The study argues that existing theories should be expanded to cover not only cognitive beliefs but also the emotion provoked by the sharing nature of the technology. Based on the theory of reasoned action, the technology adoption literature, and the trust literature, we theoretically explain and empirically test the impact of perceived transparency of privacy policy on cognitive trust and emotional trust in HIEs. Moreover, the study analyzes the effects of cognitive trust and emotional trust on the intention to opt in to HIEs and willingness to disclose health information.Design/methodology/approachAn online survey was conducted using data from individuals who were aware of HIEs through experience with at least one provider participating in an HIE network. Data were collected from a wide range of adult population groups in the United States.FindingsThe structural equation modeling analysis results provide empirical support for the proposed model. The model highlights the strategic role of the perceived transparency of the privacy policy in building trust in HIEs. When patients know more about HIE security measures, sharing procedures, and privacy terms, they feel more in control, more assured, and less at risk. The results also show that patient trust in HIEs may take the forms of intention to opt in to an HIE and willingness to disclose health information exchanged through HIE networks.Originality/valueThe findings of this study should be of interest to both academics and practitioners.

We found that security, privacy (including awareness, information collection, and control), and reputation (including company background and consumer reviews) have a strong effect on trust and willingness to purchase, while website quality plays only a marginal role. Although the perception of trustworthiness and purchasing intention were positively correlated, in some cases participants were more willing to buy from a website that they judged as untrustworthy with regard to privacy. We investigated how behavioral biases and decision-making heuristics may explain the discrepancy between perception and behavioral intention.

We argue that this lack of emphasis is a substantive and strategic error and seek to rectify it. This refocusing is particularly timely given the proliferation of new and invasive technologies for the home and for consumer use more generally, not to mention surveillance technologies such as so-called smart cities. Indeed, we argue--perhaps for the first time in modern conversations about privacy--that in many cases privacy is safety, and that, in practice, US law already recognizes this fact. Although the connection rarely figures in contemporary conversations about privacy, the relationship is implicitly recognized in a substantial but diverse body of US law that protects privacy as a direct means of protecting safety. As evidence we offer a survey of the ways in which US law already recognizes that privacy is safety, or at least that privacy enhances safety. Following modern reformulations of Alan Westin's four zones of privacy, we explore the safety-enhancing privacy protections within the personal, intimate, semi-private, and public zones of life, and find examples in each zone, although cases in which privacy protects physical safety seem particularly frequent. We close by noting that new technologies such as the Internet of Things and connected cars create privacy gaps that can endanger their users' safety, suggesting the need for new safety-enhancing privacy rules in these areas. By emphasizing the deep connection between privacy and safety, we seek to lay a foundation for planned future work arguing that US administrative agencies with a safety mission should make privacy protection one of their goals.","","Automobile industry,Internet of Things,Law,Privacy,Product recalls,Public safety,Regulation,Smart cities,Surveillance,Surveillance of citizens,Technological change,Theory,United States--US","",""

This paper supplies both theoretical and empirical reasons to question the standard market failure conclusion. On the theoretical side, I argue that digital markets are not qualitatively different from markets for other consumer goods. To wit, just as in traditional markets, it is costly to measure product attributes (such as “privacy”) and, just as in more traditional settings, some firms offer credible commitments to reduce the threat of potential opportunism. On the empirical side, I conduct a survey of Google's users. The most important results of this survey suggest that, at least with respect to Google, (a) the extent of informational asymmetry is minimal and (b) the demands for “unconstrained” and “constrained” privacy diverge substantially. Significantly, 86{\%} of respondents express no willingness to pay for additional privacy when interacting with Google. Among the remaining 14{\%}, the average expressed willingness to pay is low.","","Asymmetric information,Bias,Consumer goods,Customers,D23,D62,Digital privacy,Externality,K24,L86,Market failure,Markets,Polls {\&} surveys,Privacy,Privacy paradox,Resale,Respondents,Sociology,Survey,Willingness,Willingness to pay,Wisdom","",""

In particular, it explores how these different perspectives can help bringing politics back into the study and the critique of surveillance. Visibility is structurally linked to invisibility, and together they configure the different modes of in/visibility allowing for the very functioning of surveillance. However, the in/visibility dyad, rather than merely describe surveillance, contributes to its operations and stabilisation. In order to better understand and unpack surveillance it is thus necessary to tackle its practices, not only in search of who watches whom, or what, but also by studying what is concealed through in/visibility, through both hiding and exposing, and what is left out of the scene (or being pushed away) in these processes. In a dialogue with Surveillance Studies and critical security studies, this contribution examines the disappearance of bodies in the deployment of security scanners and post-Snowden developments to illustrate the productivity of dis-appearance and the emergence of surveillance's ob-scene. Against this background, the paper argues that through the lens of the ob-scene it is possible to grasp surveillance's ripples, and open up their political discussion.","","0925:political sociology/interactions; sociology of political systems, politics, {\&} power,Belgium,Discipline,Foucault, Michel,Lyon, David,Magid, Jill,New York,Politics,Prisoners,Productivity,Security,Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works,Surveillance","",""

If this information is accessed by an unauthorized party, identity theft or other fraud may result. The affected organization may face fines or other penalties, in addition to notification and security upgrade costs related to the breach. Further, companies may incur costs resulting from litigation stemming from the potential liability exposure. For these reasons, an examination of the stock market's assessment of the costs of data breaches is warranted. One of the most significant events in the history of data breaches occurred at ChoicePoint. In February 2005, ChoicePoint, self-described as the "nation's leading provider of identification and credential verification services" (ChoicePoint, 2006), disclosed that thieves had created false accounts for the purpose of obtaining personal information with which to commit identity theft and subsequent fraud. Initially, ChoicePoint estimated that the information of 140,000 people had been compromised, and at the time of the announcement, more than 700 documented instances of identity theft had already been directly linked to the data breach (Weber, 2005). Since that time, the incidence of exposures that could lead to identity theft has noticeably increased. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer information and advocacy organization, estimates more than 440 instances of reported exposures to potential identity theft have occurred between the February 2005 ChoicePoint incident and December 2006 due to data breaches at corporations, universities, and government agencies. The organization further estimates that the number of records exposed in these breaches exceeds 100 million (Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, 2007).","","3400:Investment analysis {\&} personal finance,4300:Law,5200:Communications {\&} information management,8200:Insurance industry,9190:United States,Data integrity,Effects,Employees,Insurance,Insurance industry,Personal information,Shareholders wealth,United States--US","",""

This concern has continued to grow due to an increase in the number of data breaches across all industries. The passage of federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as the passage of a variety of state legislation related to privacy breaches has changed the way in which firms deal with these issues. Currently, there also are several pending federal pieces of legislation that could impact insurers and others that maintain databases containing personal information susceptible to breaches. In 2000, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners formed a Privacy Issues Working Group to study the problem to focus on consumer privacy protection efforts in the insurance industry. This article outlines the privacy breach implications for insurers. Specifically, we focus on examples of recent breaches in the insurance industry and the cost of breaches to firms and individuals. We review the state legislation related to privacy breaches, the implications of several major federal acts on the issues, as well as current proposed federal legislation.

The concept of identity theft which was more known in the Western world is making its presence felt in developing economies like India. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to review the current scenario of phishing attacks in India and provide some countermeasures that can be adopted by online firms to fight this kind of attack. A few statistics related to the phishing attacks worldwide are compared with India's to gauge the severity of the problem. Security measures adopted by a few banks worldwide are reviewed and are compared with their counterparts in India. In the end, some guidelines are furnished on how to tackle the situation. There has been an increase in identity theft in the last few years which could pose a serious problem in the future, resulting in loss of trust by the customer towards net banking. Most of the Indian banks are taking initiatives to address the problem but still more work is to be done in the case of small and rural banks. Since identity theft is not only a concern of one individual but the responsibility of the concerned financial firm, measures needs to be taken to protect the identity and data of their online customers. This paper is an attempt to assess the present situation. Efforts have been made to come out with the security measures that can be adopted by different firms in enhancing security and protect the identity of their online customers.","","45411:Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses,5250:Telecommunications systems {\&} Internet communications,8100:Financial services industry,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9179:Asia {\&} the Pacific,Banking industry,Business And Economics--Banking And Finance,Developing countries--LDCs,Electronic commerce,Financial institutions,Identity theft,India,Recessions,Studies","",""

Existing research mostly describes data privacy as a necessary evil for compliance and risk management and does not propose specific data privacy measures which address the customers' concerns. We therefore aim to shed light on the upside of data privacy. In this paper, we derive specific measures to deal with customers' data privacy concerns based on academic literature, legislative texts, corporate privacy statements, and expert interviews. Next, we leverage the Kano model and data from two internet-based surveys to analyze the measures' evaluation by customers. From a customer perspective, the implementation of the majority of measures is obligatory as those measures are considered as basic needs of must-be quality. However, delighting measures of attractive quality do exist and have the potential to create a competitive advantage. In this, we find some variation across different industries suggesting that corporations aiming to improve customer satisfaction by superior privacy protection should elicit the demands of their specific target customers.","","45411:Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses,Business And Economics--Computer Applications,Business competition,Competitive advantage,Compliance,Computer privacy,Customer data,Customer satisfaction,Customers,Electronic commerce,Information technology,Leverage,M3,Privacy,Privacy concerns,Privacy measures,Risk management,Survey research","",""

Thus, deploying suitable risk treatments requires the investigation of how the digital natives (young people, born and bred in the digital era) use their mobile devices and their level of security awareness, in order to identify common usage patterns with negative security impact. In this article, we present the results of a survey performed across a multinational sample of digital natives with distinct backgrounds and levels of competence in terms of security, to identify divergences in user behavior due to regional, educational and other factors. Our results highlight significant influences on the behavior of digital natives, arising from user confidence, educational background, and parameters related to usability and accessibility.

There is a massive variety of crime types and crime names in the literature that can successfully be allocated to main categories of financial crime. The paper is based on exploratory research to stimulate future research in refining and improving the categories suggested here. The great variety of criminal activities is classified in this paper so that practitioners can organize their thinking around crime themes rather than crime examples when mapping crime. The public and society at large will be able to understand the confusing variety of financial crime in terms of main categories.

Brandeis published an article in the Harvard Law Review entitled ‘‘The Right to Privacy.'' Protecting privacy today is an onerous task. Information on medical conditions, online activities, smart phone usage, emails, consumer choices, library loans, and even our location and how we got there, is all easily accessed, with or without our permission, or even knowledge. However, in many cases, ‘‘privacy'' has come to mean little more than regulation of the flow of vast amounts of information. Two major pieces of federal legislation passed in recent years illustrate this development: The Final Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Final Rule on Privacy of Consumer Financial Information. In this paper, I argue that the concept of access-based privacy is both dominant in current discourse and very different from the more substantive interpretation of the right alluded to by Warren and Brandeis.Normative privacy protects more than control over our transactions, be they with our doctor or a bank. What follows is, first, a brief history of the meaning – or meanings – of privacy in both legal and moral contexts with a description of three different kinds: informational, territorial, and constitutional privacy.

Globally, we are experiencing unprecedented cyberspace criminal activity comprising terrorism, espionage, extortion schemes, global financial system attacks, human trafficking, and ransomware. Criminal activity does not just focus on taking the cyber network hostage; it could disrupt life-saving medical equipment, the aviation industry, or power grids that impact essential services to citizens around the globe. Most research to date has been focused on the enactment of criminal legislation, investigative tools, and prosecution of cybercrimes, but very little attention has been given to post-conviction matters such as sentencing, deterrence or victim impact. The purpose of this research is to survey the cybercrime laws both in the United States and the European Union, and provide a comparative analysis of the variation in these laws and recommendations for improvement. The question of whether the punishment is tailored to fit the crime has raised interest from a national and international perspective due not only to the diversity of cybercrime laws, but the deterrent impact from the penalty or punishment that can be imposed in a case. Some scholars and experts find the sanctions, penalties and punishments too severe, while others argue the law does not go far enough to punish the cybercriminal. The sanctions and punishment for recent high profile cybercriminal activity will be analyzed. Through empirical research the paper identifies the criminal frameworks of selected countries and provides examples of model criminal cyber laws that include the penalties most important in combatting and deterring criminals in cyberspace.","","Computer security,Computers--Computer Security,Crime,Empirical analysis,Equipment costs,Espionage,Extortion,Federal court decisions,Internet,Internet crime,Jurisdiction,Legislation,Medical equipment,Supreme Court decisions,Terrorism,Treaties,United States--US","",""

Last updated - 2020-06-17","This contribution examines the developing contours of the essence of the fundamental right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial in the light of salient case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. It is divided into three main parts. The first part provides an overview of the meaning of the essence of fundamental rights in EU law and the scope of the inquiry in relation to Article 47 of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union (“the Charter”). The second part evaluates the essence of the fundamental right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial in connection with justified limitations that may be placed on its exercise as provided for in Article 52(1) of the Charter within the framework of the EU system of fundamental rights protection, which in turn implicates the relationship with the Court's case-law on national procedural autonomy, equivalence, and effectiveness. The third part delves into the essence of the fundamental right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial within the framework of the EU system of judicial protection, as illustrated by the Court's case-law in several areas, including standing for individuals in direct actions before the EU courts, judicial independence, and restrictive measures in the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Through this analysis, the author argues that, while much awaits further refinement, certain recent developments in the Court's case–law indicate that the essence of the fundamental right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial can play a meaningful role in the EU system of fundamental rights protection and the EU system of judicial protection more broadly, and thus the best may be yet to come as that case-law progresses in the future.","","Article 47 of the Charter,Autonomy,Charters,Common Foreign and Security Policy,Contours,Courts,Human rights,International law,Judicial reviews,Justice,Law,Meaning,Procedural justice,Security policy,Trials,effective judicial protection,essence,judicial independence,justified limitations,restrictive measures","",""

Current applications of Cloud involve extensive use of distributed systems with varying degree of connectivity and usage. With a recent focus on large-scale proliferation of Cloud computing, identity management in Cloud based systems is a critical issue for the sustainability of any Cloud-based service. This area has also received considerable attention from the research community as well as the IT industry. Numerous Cloud Identity Management Systems (IDMSs) have been proposed so far; however, most of those systems are neither widely accepted nor considered highly reliable due to their constraints in terms of scope, applicability and security. In order to achieve reliability and effectiveness in IDMs for Cloud, further extensive research needs to be carried out to critically examine Cloud based IDMSs and their level of security.   In this work, we have holistically analyzed Cloud IDMSs to better understand the general as well as the security aspects of this domain. From the security perspective, we present a comprehensive list of attacks that occur frequently in Cloud based IDMSs. In order to alleviate those attacks, we present a well-organized taxonomy tree covering the most desired features essential for any Cloud-based IDMSs. Additionally, we have specified various mechanisms of realization (such as access control polices, encryption, self-service) against each of the features of Cloud IDMSs. We have further used the proposed taxonomy as an assessment criterion for the evaluation of Cloud based IDMSs.   Our in-depth analysis of various Cloud based IDMSs reveals that most of the systems do not offer support to all the essential features of Cloud IDMS and the ones that do, have their own certain weaknesses. None of the discussed techniques heuristically covers all the security features; moreover, they lack compliance to international standards which, understandably, undermines their credibility.   Presented work will help Cloud subscribers and providers in understanding the available solutions as well as the involved risks, allowing them to make more knowledgeable decisions while selecting potential Cloud IDMSs that best suits their functional and security requirements.","","Computers--Computer Simulation","",""

In fact, sometimes personal or sensitive information could get viral if that leaks out even unintentionally. Any leaked out content can be shared and made a topic of popular talk all over the world within few seconds with the help of the social networking sites. In the setting of Internet of Things (IoT) that would connect millions of devices, such contents could be shared from anywhere anytime. Considering such a setting, in this work, we investigate the key security and privacy concerns faced by individuals who use different social networking sites differently for different reasons.

Since the dawn of the internet, Congress has repeatedly failed to build a robust identity for American privacy law.  "2 Data protection regimes that follow the GDPR typically follow what Margot Kaminski calls a "binary governance" approach that combines individual due process rights with a collaborative governance approach to follow and protect personal data to ensure it is always processed fairly.3 Data protection regimes long predate the GDPR, but the GDPR has had the unexpected effect of turning European-style privacy protection into a global market norm, an example of what Anu Bradford has termed the "Brussels Effect," and what Paul Schwartz calls "global data privacy the EU way.  "7 Ye t t h e U.S. Congress has not updated its rules and permissive "notice and choice" approach to privacy in years.8 Instead, states have taken the mantle and have begun creating their own data protection legislation.9 At least partially as a result of the Brussels Effect, American state legislatures have started to pass state-level data protection statutes, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).10 The CCPA applies in California, but because many companies are either headquartered in or do business in Silicon Valley's home state, it will have national consequences when it comes into effect in 2020.11 Other states like Washington have also begun to consider their own mini-GDPRs, and after years of opposition to regulation, big tech companies have started to call for a baseline privacy law.12 These calls are often paired with arguments for federal preemption to avoid multiple state data governance regimes, particularly from more aggressive state regulators.13 Although preemption advocates often claim that unification will help make U.S. privacy laws adequate in the eyes of the EU, any omnibus bill that is likely to be passed seems destined to be a watered-down version of the GDPR, given the trans-Atlantic differences in rights, cultures, commitments, and regulatory appetites.14 Congress now finds itself sandwiched between bottom-up momentum from the states, and top-down influence from emerging international norms and foreign law.  In this Article, we suggest that something analogous is happening in privacy law in the United States-after decades of accommodating the internet and digital technologies into existing and often poorly fitting legal structures, we are on the cusp of a set of legal changes that will structure our emergent digital society for decades to come.19 It might seem at this point like there is not much of a decision to be made regarding the identity of U.S. privacy law.","","Accountability,Big Data,California,Citizen participation,Constitutional law,Consumer protection,Data processing,Digital currencies,Europe,Federalism,General Data Protection Regulation,Law,Preemption,Privacy,Silicon Valley-California,Social networks,United States--US","",""

Cyber victimization (CV), on the other hand, expresses exposure to CB behaviors. In this study, we utilize General Strain Theory (GST) as the theoretical basis to examine the relationship between CB and exposure to CV among university students. GST explains that individuals may display aberrant behaviors in order to alleviate psychological strains and the negative emotions they experience. Accordingly, individuals who experienced CV may display CB when the conditions are suitable. With that in mind, we examined the relationship between CB and CV using a relational screening model with participation of 3302 university students. We found, consistent with the literature, a direct relationship between CB and CV in all models. However, it was determined that their mediating effects are not meaningful when the variables of metacognitive and digital data security awareness (DDSA) are added to the model separately. When these two variables are added to the model together as the mediator at the same time, DDSA negatively mediates the relation between CB and CV. Including various activities aiming to develop DDSA within intervention programs for CB and CV, may improve positive outcomes for participants.HighlightsThere is a significant relationship between CB and CV.The borders between CB and CV are unclear and have a transitive structure.Metacognitive awareness and DDSA are together effective as the mediator variable on CB and CV.In this study, developing two new dimensions (metacognitive awareness and DDSA) will have significant contributions for the intervention programs on CB and CV.","","Behavior,Bullying,College students,Cyber victimization,Cyberbullying,Digital data security awareness,Emotions,General strain theory,Intervention,Metacognition,Metacognitive awareness,Negative emotions,Psychology,Screening,Strain theory,University students,Victimization","",""

Yet, the sharing of one's genetic data for research is a voluntary act. The collection of data sufficient to fuel rapid advancement is contingent on individuals' willingness to share. Privacy risks associated with sharing this unique and intensely personal data are significant. Genetic data are an unambiguous identifier. Public linkage of donor to their genetic data could reveal predisposition to diseases, behaviors, paternity, heredity, intelligence, etc. The purpose of this paper is to understand individuals' willingness to volunteer their private information in this high-risk/high-reward context.Design/methodology/approachThe authors collect survey data from 273 respondents and use structural equation modeling techniques to analyze responses.FindingsThe authors find statistical support for our theorization. They find that while heightened awareness of the benefits and risks of sharing correlates with increased privacy concerns, the net impact is an increase in intention to share.Social implicationsThe findings suggest that prescriptive awareness might be an effective tool with which policy-makers can gain the sufficient voluntary participation from individuals necessary to drive large-scale medical research.Originality/valueThis study contributes a theoretically and empirically informed model which demonstrates the impact of awareness and privacy concern on individuals' willingness to share their genetic data for large-scale HGR.

We have designed and implemented a prototype technology platform for providing home-based healthcare services. It supports a personal electronic health diary and enables secure and reliable communication and interaction with peers and healthcare personnel. The platform runs on a small computer with a dedicated remote control. It is connected to the patient's TV and to a broadband Internet. The platform has been tested with home-based rehabilitation and education programs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. As part of our work, a risk assessment of privacy and security aspects has been performed, to reveal actual risks and to ensure adequate information security in this technical platform.   Methods: Risk assessment was performed in an iterative manner during the development process. Thus, security solutions have been incorporated into the design from an early stage instead of being included as an add-on to a nearly completed system. We have adapted existing risk management methods to our own environment, thus creating our own method. Our method conforms to ISO's standard for information security risk management.   Results: A total of approximately 50 threats and possible unwanted incidents were identified and analysed. Among the threats to the four information security aspects: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and quality; confidentiality threats were identified as most serious, with one threat given an unacceptable level of High risk. This is because health-related personal information is regarded as sensitive. Availability threats were analysed as low risk, as the aim of the home programmes is to provide education and rehabilitation services; not for use in acute situations or for continuous health monitoring.   Conclusions: Most of the identified threats are applicable for healthcare services intended for patients or citizens in their own homes. Confidentiality risks in home are different from in a more controlled environment such as a hospital; and electronic equipment located in private homes and communicating via Internet, is more exposed to unauthorised access. By implementing the proposed measures, it has been possible to design a home-based service which ensures the necessary level of information security and privacy.","","Chronic Disease -- rehabilitation,Chronic Disease -- therapy,Computer Security -- legislation {\&} jurisprudence,Computer Security -- standards,Confidentiality,Health Insurance Portability {\&} Accountability Act,Home Care Services -- legislation {\&} jurisprudence,Home Care Services -- standards,Humans,Medical Sciences--Computer Applications,Models, Statistical,Outcome {\&} Process Assessment (Health Care) -- meth,Outcome {\&} Process Assessment (Health Care) -- stan,Patient Education as Topic,Qualitative Research,Risk Assessment -- methods,United States","",""

To understand the drawbacks of this line of thought, I will explore the relationship between online security technologies and fundamental rights, notably privacy, nondiscrimination, freedom of speech and due process. After discriminating between three types of online security technologies, I will trace the reconfiguration of the notion of privacy in the era of smart environments. This will lead to an inquiry into the metaphor of the scale, building on the triple test regarding the justification of the limitation of fundamental rights such as privacy. The conclusion will be that in the case of a trade-off, infringing measures will have to be balanced by effective safeguards.

It's just someone else's computer.” Despite the loss of control that comes with its use, critical records are increasingly being entrusted to the cloud, generating ever-growing concern about the privacy and security of those records. Ultimately, privacy and security constitute an attempt to balance competing needs: privacy balances the need to use information against the need to protect personal data, while security balances the need to provide access to records against the need to stop unauthorized access. The importance of these issues has led to a multitude of legal and regulatory efforts to find a balance and, ultimately, to ensure trust in both digital records and their storage in the cloud. Adding a particular challenge is the fact that distinct jurisdictions approach privacy differently and an in-depth understanding of what a jurisdiction's laws may be, or even under what jurisdiction particular data might be, requires a Herculean effort. And yet, in order to protect privacy and enhance security, this effort is required. This article examines two legal tools for ensuring the privacy and security of records in the cloud, data protection laws, and data localization laws, through the framework of “trust” as understood in archival science. This framework of trust provides new directions for algorithmic research, identifying those areas of digital record creation and preservation most in need of novel solutions.","","52:Numerical Analysis, Simulation, and Modeling (C,Archives {\&} records,Cloud computing,Computer security,Jurisdiction,Laws,Mathematics,Privacy","",""

In part 2, we develop the argument that it is inappropriate for infrastructure cloud providers, many of which are based outside Europe, to become subject arbitrarily to EU Data Protection Directive obligations due to their users' choices. EU data protection responsibilities are imposed primarily on controllers, who may engage processors. We suggest that end-to-end accountability should replace the binary controller/processor distinction, given today's environment of complex chains of actors. While cloud computing providers are commonly considered processors or controllers, we further argue that many providers are not even processors, but simply provide resources for use by others. Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and certain Software as a Service providers, who offer no more than utility infrastructure, will often not know whether information processed through their services is personal data - hence, the cloud of unknowing. They are qualitatively distinct from services like social networking websites. We suggest such providers should be considered mere neutral intermediaries. Existing liability defences for certain providers under the EU Electronic Commerce Directive, to help foster electronic commerce, cease upon the provider having knowledge and control. Similarly, our proposed intermediary immunity from data protection obligations would cease if the provider gains the requisite knowledge and/or requisite access to personal data. It may also behove cloud computing providers to develop appropriate industry standards/best practices to help provide a clear boundary between this intermediary status and processor (or even controller) status.","","2410:Social responsibility,4310:Regulation,45411:Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses,5140:Security management,5250:Telecommunications systems {\&} Internet communications,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9175:Western Europe,Cloud computing,Consumer protection,Data integrity,Electronic commerce,Europe,Infrastructure,Law,Professional liability,Right of privacy,Studies","",""

A systematic literature review of healthcare consumer attitudes towards the secondary use and sharing of health administrative and clinical trial data was conducted. EMBASE/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL, Informit Health Collection, PROSPERO Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, and ProQuest databases were searched. Eligible articles included those reporting qualitative or quantitative original research and published in English. No restrictions were placed on publication dates, study design or disease setting. One author screened articles for eligibility, and two authors were involved in the full text review process. Data was extracted using a pre-piloted data extraction template by one author and checked by another. Conflicts were resolved by consensus. Quality and bias were assessed using the QualSyst criteria for qualitative and quantitative studies. This paper focuses on a subset of 35 articles identified from the wider search which focus on issues of privacy, trust, and transparency. Studies included a total of 56,365 respondents. Results of this systematic literature review indicate that while respondents identified advantages in sharing health data, concerns relating to trust, transparency, and privacy remain. Organisations collecting health data and those who seek to share data or undertake secondary data analysis should continue to develop trust, transparency, and privacy with healthcare consumers through open dialogue and education. Consideration should be given to these issues at all stages of data collection including the conception, design, and implementation phases. While individuals understand the benefits of health data sharing for research purposes, ensuring a balance between public benefit and individual privacy is essential. Researchers and those undertaking secondary data analysis need to be cognisant of these key issues at all stages of their research.

The dilemma is twofold: First, scholarly studies undertaken on this issue from a principally administrative and legal point of view tend to lack a moral framework and so prove unable to offer an integral understanding. Second, a majority of scholars tend to focus exclusively on individual rights, such as privacy, even at the risk of overlooking its social impact and consequences. This paper thus aims to unravel these forgotten moral and social concerns. It analyses the surveillance frameworks and the arguments for and against it; scrutinises critically the technological devices most often implemented in the workplace; examines both its individual effects (privacy) and social effects (categorising); and proposes an ethics of workplace surveillance in a framework of trust and transparency. It argues, in all these ways, for an alteration or modification of traditional organisational behaviour within a new frame of reference, situated within and going beyond questions of moral duty, principles and legal compliance.","","Law,On-the-job,Power distance,Privacy,Social-sorting,Surveillance,Transparency,Trust","",""

After identifying the benefits from various AI usages and the risks posed by AI-related technologies, I then analyze legal frameworks and relevant discussions in the EU, USA, Canada, and Japan, and further consider the efforts of Privacy by Design (“PbD”) originating in Ontario, Canada. While various AI usages provide great convenience, many issues, including profiling, discriminatory decisions, lack of transparency, and impeding consent, have emerged. The unpredictability arising from the AI machine learning function poses further difficulties, which have only been partially addressed by legal frameworks in the aforementioned jurisdictions. However, analyzing the relevant discussions yielded several suggestions. The first priority is adopting PbD as the most flexible, soft-legal, and preferable approach toward AI-oriented issues. Implementing PbD will protect individual privacy and personal data without specific efforts, and achieve both the development of AI and the advancement of privacy and personal data protection. Technical measures that can adapt to an individual's dynamic choices according to the “context” should be further developed. Furthermore, alternative technical measures, including those to solve the “algorithmic black box” or achieve differential privacy, warrant thorough examination. If AI surpasses human intelligence, a terminating function, such as a “kill switch” will be the last resort to preserve individual choice. Despite numerous difficulties, we must prepare for the coming AI-prevalent society by taking a flexible approach.","","Artificial intelligence,Comparative study,Computers--Artificial Intelligence,Learning algorithms,Machine learning,Personal data,Privacy,Profiling,Robots","",""

In addition, the paper aims at establishing how they interfere with user privacy and determine the users' level of awareness. Design/Methods/Approach: For the purpose of this paper, existing literature was reviewed and analysed, and a questionnaire was distributed in a digital form. 229 respondents participated in the survey. Findings: It has been found that smart energy meters collect very accurate information about users' electricity consumption at short intervals. The information can then be used to identify devices, identify the presence or absence of people, their habits and activities. According to the survey results, the awareness among people using smart energy meters is low. Research Limitations/Implications: The limitations stem from the survey sample, as only people who are users of online social networks, e-mail and internet messaging applications (Viber, WhatsApp) were included in the survey. Practical Implications: The paper presents key findings in the field of smart energy meters and their potential for compromising individuals' safety and privacy. The paper discusses different ways in which energy consumption information can be exploited and used to harm users, as well as methods for establishing a secure and reliable network. Originality/Value: Due to the increasing share of smart energy meters installed in Slovenia, there is an increasing risk of privacy intrusions and threats to the safety of individuals. The research findings will help increasing users' awareness about smart energy meters and prevent potential abuse of their data.Alternate abstract:Namen prispevka: Namen prispevka je predstaviti klju{\v{c}}ne lastnosti pametnih merilnikov energije, njihove prednosti in slabosti ter ugotoviti, kako posegajo v uporabnikovo zasebnost in kak{\v{s}}no zavedanje o tem imajo ljudje.

Hereto, multi-stakeholder consortia are currently designing several disease-specific translational research platforms to enable international health data sharing. Despite the recent adoption of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the procedures for how to govern responsible data sharing in such projects are not at all spelled out yet. In search of a first, basic outline of an ethical governance framework, we set out to explore relevant ethical principles and norms. Methods We performed a systematic review of literature and ethical guidelines for principles and norms pertaining to data sharing for international health research. Results We observed an abundance of principles and norms with considerable convergence at the aggregate level of four overarching themes: societal benefits and value; distribution of risks, benefits and burdens; respect for individuals and groups; and public trust and engagement. However, at the level of principles and norms we identified substantial variation in the phrasing and level of detail, the number and content of norms considered necessary to protect a principle, and the contextual approaches in which principles and norms are used. Conclusions While providing some helpful leads for further work on a coherent governance framework for data sharing, the current collection of principles and norms prompts important questions about how to streamline terminology regarding de-identification and how to harmonise the identified principles and norms into a coherent governance framework that promotes data sharing while securing public trust.","","Big Data,Big data,Collaboration,Consortia,Data sharing,Ethical governance,Ethics,Evidence-based medicine,Genomics,Information sharing,Medical research,Philosophy,Privacy,Public health,Regulation,Research ethics,Secondary use,Systematic review,Working groups","",""

Cloud provides various types of services to us. Database Outsourcing is a recent data management paradigm in which the data owner stores the confidential data at the third party service provider's site. The service provider is responsible for managing and administering the database and allows the data owner and clients to create, update, delete and access the database. There are chances of hampering the security of the data due to untrustworthiness of service provider. So, to secure the data which is outsourced to third party is a great challenge. The major requirements for achieving security in outsourced databases are confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability. To achieve these requirements various data confidentiality mechanisms like fragmentation approach, High-Performance Anonymization Engine approach etc are available. In this paper, various mechanisms for implementing Data Confidentiality in cloud computing are analyzed along with their usefulness in a great detail.","","Computers","",""

However, individuals increasingly fear how such practices may negatively affect them. Although previous studies have investigated individuals' concerns about information privacy practices, the adverse consequences people associate with external actors accessing their personal information remain unclear. To mitigate customers' fears, organisations need to know which adverse consequences individuals are afraid of and how to address those negative perceptions. To investigate this topic, we conducted 22 focus groups with 119 participants. We developed a comprehensive conceptualisation and categorisation of individuals' perceived adverse consequences of access to their information that includes seven types of consequences: psychological, social, career-related, physical, resource-related, prosecution-related, and freedom-related. Although individuals may limit their interactions with an organisation owing to consequences they associate with both the organisation and other actors, organisations can apply preventive and corrective mechanisms to mitigate some of these negative perceptions. However, organisations' scope of influence is limited and some fears may be mitigated only by individuals themselves or government regulation, if at all.","","Computers--Computer Networks,Customer services,Data analysis,Perceptions,Personal information,access to individuals' information,focus group study,information privacy,mitigation mechanisms,perceived adverse consequences","",""

In this article, we explore consumer information privacy issues and review the results of related prior research. We provide a survey of the literature on information privacy based on our assessment from: (1) the societal and public policy perspective, (2) the business practices perspective, and (3) the individual privacy and consumer behavior perspectives that relate to the disclosure of private information by individuals to firms. From the societal and public policy perspective, we identify a number of research directions that relate to the social welfare implications of personal information surveillance, the safeguards needed at the societal level, and the nature of privacy-enhancing regulations. From the business practices perspective, we suggest other research directions that involve the examination of factors influencing organizational choices of privacy practices. We also offer some ways to discover how organizations can leverage their investments in information privacy. The individual and consumer behavior perspective, in turn, prompts Accounting Information Systems (AIS) researchers to look at the nature of people's beliefs and attitudes about privacy; the ways such attitudes affect their intentions and behaviors; and how individuals' behaviors can be influenced by organizational privacy policies and practices. The main contribution of this article is to understand these issues and identify opportunities for AIS researchers to enrich the current body of knowledge on this critical topic.

Some IoT applications are already on the market, such as in a smart home, wearable, connected vehicle, medical and healthcare, smart grids, and so on. However, the increasing use of IoT, especially in the individual domain, causes the opening of security vulnerabilities. Various studies have attempted to identify security issues on IoT. Many studies indicate that data privacy is one of the primary considerations in IoT because of the high possibility of creating security risks, such as unauthorized access, tapping, data modification, data forgery and so on. Some IoT services and applications provide personal and sensitive information openly and can be misused because of the leakage of data to third parties. Several studies state that the enforcement mechanism of IoT is still inadequate. Besides, there are issues such as identification problems, authentication and authorization, and cross-device dependencies. From the various vulnerabilities, threat sources have been identified by previous researchers apart from bad manufacturers and outside parties, namely IoT users themselves as owners of devices that intentionally or unintentionally provide access to sensitive information. From that case, user awareness becomes a critical aspect of the IoT ecosystem. Some countries are known to have prepared themselves with strategies and master plans in dealing with the IoT era. This study seeks to identify what efforts have been made by the government and other stakeholders in promoting IoT security for end-users in various countries and what best practices can be learned from existing initiatives, and what aspects might still need further research.","","Australia,Authentication,Computer privacy,Computers--Computer Security,End users,Internet of Things,Security management,Singapore,Smart buildings,Smart grid,Studies,United States--US","",""

However, security and privacy concerns are shown to be the primary obstacles to a wide adoption of clouds. The new concepts that clouds introduce, such as multi-tenancy, resource sharing and outsourcing, create new challenges to the security community. Addressing these challenges requires, in addition to the ability to cultivate and tune the security measures developed for traditional computing systems, proposing new security policies, models, and protocols to address the unique cloud security challenges. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of cloud computing security and privacy concerns. We identify cloud vulnerabilities, classify known security threats and attacks, and present the state-of-the-art practices to control the vulnerabilities, neutralize the threats, and calibrate the attacks. Additionally, we investigate and identify the limitations of the current solutions and provide insights of the future security perspectives.

Unfortunately, U.S. laws do not have a unified and coherent vision for the regulation and promotion of cybersecurity. For that matter, the U.S. legal system lacks a consistent definition of the term "cybersecurity law." This Article aims to fill that gap by defining "cybersecurity law." Although many articles have addressed various aspects of cybersecurity, none has stepped back to define exactly what "cybersecurity" is and the goals of statutes and regulations that aim to promote cybersecurity. By defining the scope and goals of this new legal field, policymakers can then examine how lawmakers could improve existing laws. Part II of this Article briefly describes the cybersecurity challenges that the United States faces by examining the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. Part III defines "cybersecurity law" as a legal framework that "promotes the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of public and private information, systems, and networks, through the use of forward-looking regulations and incentives, with the goal of protecting individual rights and privacy, economic interests, and national security. " Part IV explains the current legal regime for cybersecurity and concludes that many of the most prominent cybersecurity laws only address a small portion of the broader legal framework. Part V examines the gaps in current U.S. cybersecurity law and suggests starting points for improvements.","","92111:Executive Offices,92811:National Security,Appropriations,China,Collaboration,Computer crime,Computer security,Confidentiality,Data integrity,Employees,Federal government,Information systems,Internet crime,Law,Legislation,Legislators,National security,Presidents,Privacy,Russia,State elections,Threats,United States--US","",""

These computing capabilities introduce security and privacy risks, yet little is known about the prevalence of such risks within the clinical setting. Methods We used three comprehensive, publicly available databases maintained by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate recalls and adverse events related to security and privacy risks of medical devices. Results Review of weekly enforcement reports identified 1,845 recalls; 605 (32.8{\%}) of these included computers, 35 (1.9{\%}) stored patient data, and 31 (1.7{\%}) were capable of wireless communication. Searches of databases specific to recalls and adverse events identified only one event with a specific connection to security or privacy. Software-related recalls were relatively common, and most (81.8{\%}) mentioned the possibility of upgrades, though only half of these provided specific instructions for the update mechanism. Conclusions Our review of recalls and adverse events from federal government databases reveals sharp inconsistencies with databases at individual providers with respect to security and privacy risks. Recalls related to software may increase security risks because of unprotected update and correction mechanisms. To detect signals of security and privacy problems that adversely affect public health, federal postmarket surveillance strategies should rethink how to effectively and efficiently collect data on security and privacy problems in devices that increasingly depend on computing systems susceptible to malware.","","Adverse events,Automation,Communication,Communication equipment,Computation,Computer networks,Computer programs,Computer science,Computer security,Computers,Data bases,Database searching,Databases,Enforcement,FDA approval,Federal government,Information technology,Malware,Massachusetts,Medical devices,Medical devices and equipment,Medical equipment,Medical technology,Medicine,Patients,Privacy,Public health,Regulatory agencies,Sciences: Comprehensive Works,Security,Security services,Software,Software upgrading,Stent implantation,Surveillance,Telecommunications,United States--US,Web sites,Wireless communications,Wireless networks","",""

Despite the impressive scope of this phenomenon, very little is understood about what motivates users to disclose personal information. Integrating focus group results into a theoretical privacy calculus framework, we develop and empirically test a Structural Equation Model of self-disclosure with 259 subjects. We find that users are primarily motivated to disclose information because of the convenience of maintaining and developing relationships and platform enjoyment. Countervailing these benefits, privacy risks represent a critical barrier to information disclosure. However, users' perception of risk can be mitigated by their trust in the network provider and availability of control options. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for network providers.

With data breaches now a common occurrence, it is becoming increasingly plain that while modern organizations need to put into place measures to try to prevent breaches, they must also put into place processes to deal with a breach once it occurs. Prior research on information technology security and services failures suggests that customer compensation can potentially restore customer sentiment after such data breaches. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, the authors draw on the literature on personality traits and social influence to better understand the antecedents of perceived compensation and the effectiveness of compensation strategies. The authors studied the propositions using data collected in the context of Target's large-scale data breach that occurred in December 2013 and affected the personal data of more than 70 million customers. In total, the authors collected data from 212 breached customers.FindingsThe results show that customers' personality traits and their social environment significantly influences their perceptions of compensation. The authors also found that perceived compensation positively influences service recovery and customer experience.Originality/valueThe results add to the emerging literature on Big Data Analytics and will help organizations to more effectively manage compensation strategies in large-scale data breaches.","","45221:Department Stores,Analytics,Big Data,Business And Economics--Management,Compensation,Computer security,Computer viruses,Credit cards,Customer satisfaction,Customer services,Customers,Data analysis,Data integrity,Data management,Discount department stores,Information technology,Marketing,Operations management,Organizations,Perceptions,Personality,Privacy,Production management,Service restoration,Social networks,United States--US","",""

Thus, its guarantees were included in the high-level regulations of the European Union as well as the legal norms of the EU Member States. The first Polish law regulating the protection of personal data was adopted in 1997 as the implementation of EU Directive 95/46. The law imposed a number of obligations on public and private entities which process personal data in order to protect the rights of data subjects and, in particular, to guarantee them the ability to control the correctness of processing of their personal data. Therefore, the law obliged data controllers to process data only on the basis of the premises indicated in the legislation, to adequately secure data, and to comply with the disclosure obligation concerning data subjects, including their right to correct false or outdated data or to request removal of data processed in violation of the law. However, as complaints directed by citizens to the supervisory body?the Inspector General for Personal Data Protection?showed, personal data controllers, especially those operating in the private sector, did not comply with the law, acting in a manner that violated their customers? rights. In the hitherto existing unfair business practices of entrepreneurs, the violations of the data protection provisions that were the most burdensome for customers were related to preventing them from exercising their rights, including the right to control the processing of data, as well as the failure to provide the controller?s business address, which made it impossible for subjects whose data were used in violation of the law or for the inspecting authorities to contact the company, a lack of data security and a failure to follow the procedures required by law, the failure to secure documents containing personal data or their abandonment, a lack of updating customer data, the use of unverified data sets and sending marketing offers to deceased people or incorrect target recipients, and excessive amounts of data requested by controllers. The violations of the rights of data subjects recorded in Poland and other EU Member States-among other arguments-provided inspiration for the preparation of a new legal act in the form of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (which entered into force on 25 May 2018). The extension of the rights of people whose data are processed was combined in the GDPR with the introduction of new legal instruments disciplining data controllers. Instruments in the form of administrative fines and the strongly emphasised possibility to demand compensation for a violation of the right to data protection were directed in particular against economic entities violating the law.","","Business ethics,Consumer protection,Data integrity,Entrepreneurs,General Data Protection Regulation,Guarantees,Personal information,Poland,Right of privacy,Sociology","",""

Furthermore,    the provider of the health application must follow best practice    recommendations from the area of data security. Therefore, the provider    must ensure that, for example, unauthorized access, manipulation, loss,    and destruction of personal data are prevented by appropriate technical    and organizational measures. State-of-the-art procedures such as    encryption, rights management, securing integrity, pseudonymization, and    logging are some examples of technical and organizational measures. When    implementing these measures, it must be taken into account that the    processing of health data generally entails high risk for the rights and    freedoms of the data subjects and that unauthorized access to and/or    manipulation of data, for example, can lead to the publication of a    stigmatizing diagnosis or incorrect medication.}","","","",""

Finally, hospital reputation and information privacy concerns significantly predict an individual's behavioral intention toward approaching hospital web sites. Research limitations/implications - The study confirmed that an online privacy policy and reputation can effectively alleviate specific information privacy concerns; therefore, this may indicate that these two factors should be considered whenever investigating individuals' information privacy concerns. Practical implications - To acquire a good reputation and to diminish individuals' information privacy concerns toward hospital web sites, hospitals should pay attention to the posting of an online privacy policy and communicating such policies to given individuals.

Yet, previous research on the information security issue have mostly focused on the impact of information security events on firms' short-term value. Their impact on firms' long-term value is rarely analyzed. Corporate managers have also largely dismissed the negative long-term impact of information security breaches by considering them as accidental and arguing that their frequency in recent years has instigated a sense of numbness in customers to their regards. Consequently, managers have paid little attention to information security investments. To assess the importance of information security investment, this study examines short-term and long-term stock market assessment of data breaches events at publicly traded companies. The findings of this study offer new insights for firms in assessing information security investment.","","Costs,Criminal investigations,Data integrity,Efficient markets,Information management,Investment,Investments,Market value,Mathematics,Robbery,Securities markets,Security management,Short term,Studies,Theft,data breach,event study methodology,market value","",""

Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies relevant organizational theories to the health care information privacy arena, and predicts different privacy outcomes depending on the model organizations adopt to manage their information processing practices. Findings - Public policy makers who value preservation of patient health care information privacy, can predict the relative safety of information based on the organizational model used by companies which handle that data. Propositions advanced by these theories to explain business processes are reviewed to the extent they help explore the relationships between the users and managers of the digitized health records, and the privacy of the patients' health-records. The paper offers a series of implications for marketers based on the framework. Research limitations/implications - The findings are most applicable to health care systems that do not already sacrifice privacy in the name of economy. Practical implications - The findings can be used to insure the security of health care information. Originality/value - The paper addresses a recent trend motivated by the need to make health care accessible to more people. Rising health care costs have forced lawmakers and marketers to seek more efficient processes to reduce costs. One unintended consequence is that economies sacrifice privacy.

We further hypothesized that this would particularly be the case for people high on the social personality trait Extraversion, who are by inclination prone to behaving in a more socially engaging manner. We put this to the test in a controlled experiment, in which users received manipulated proactive recommendations of high or low accuracy on their smartphone.

From the beginning, concerns were raised about various issues, ranging from public safety to robot overlords. However, two problems, particularly cybersecurity and privacy, became salient in the public mind but defied easy resolution. There was little precedent in other forms of technology in protecting these now-important interests, but the glacial pace of lawmaking made addressing these two issues much more difficult. This Note proposes a viable framework by which these concerns can be addressed. Through the creation of a federal regulatory regime and consortium of federal agencies, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office of the U.S. Department of Transportation, cybersecurity and privacy concerns arising from the driverless car revolution can be addressed uniformly throughout the United States, leaving private industry and innovators with the predictability and stability they need to propel this new technology forward. New and robust cybersecurity and privacy regulations, crafted with input from the private sector, will give consumers the assurance and confidence they need to move this next step of progress forward.","","Autonomous vehicles,Communications,Computer security,Consciousness,Consumers,Federal regulation,Highway traffic,Internet crime,Management,Policy making,Privacy,Private sector,Public safety,Stability,Standards,Trade,Traffic,Transportation,Trust,United States--US","",""

One concern associated with adopting such preventive measures is the risk of privacy infringement. Therefore, it is necessary to design the future Internet infrastructure so that it can appropriately balance preventive cybersecurity measures with privacy protections. This research proposes to design the Internet infrastructure using the preventive cybersecurity measures of the Bright Internet, namely preventive cybersecurity protocol and identifiable anonymity protocol, and ten privacy rights derived from Europe's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). We then analyze the legitimacy of the five steps of the preventive cybersecurity protocol and the four features of the identifiable anonymity protocol from the perspectives of ten privacy rights. We address the legitimacy from the perspective of potential victims' self-defense rights. Finally, we discuss four potential risks that may occur to the innocent senders and proposed resilient recovery procedures.","","Bright internet,Computer crime,Computer security,Computers--Information Science And Information The,Crime,GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,Identifiable anonymity protocol,Infrastructure,Infringement,Internet,Preventive cybersecurity protocol,Privacy,Privacy rights,Right of privacy,Self-defense rights","",""

In other words, they are not up for balancing. As the seminal judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) in Schrems shows, where a measure imposes a limitation on the exercise of a fundamental right that is so intense and so comprehensive that it calls into question that right as such, that measure is incompatible with the Charter, as it deprives the right at issue of its essence. This is so without the need for a balancing exercise of competing interests, because a measure that compromises the very essence of a fundamental right is automatically disproportionate. Therefore, the present contribution supports the contention that in order for the concept of essence to function in a constitutionally meaningful way, both EU and national courts should apply the “respect-for-the-essence test” before undertaking a proportionality assessment.","","Case law,Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,Charters,Court of Justice of the European Union,Courts,Essence of fundamental rights,Human rights,Ireland,Judgments,Judicial reviews,Law,Principles,Privacy,United States--US,Values,horizontal direct effect,proportionality","",""

Personalization applications reduce information overload and provide value-added services. However, their adoption is hindered by customers' concerns about information privacy. This paper reports on research undertaken to determine whether a high-quality recommendation service will encourage customers to use online personalization. We collected data through a series of online experiments to examine the impacts of privacy and quality on personalization usage and on users' willingness to pay and to disclose information when using news and financial services. Our findings suggest that under certain circumstances, perceived personalization quality can outweigh the impact of privacy concerns. This implies that service providers can improve the perceived quality of personalization services being offered in order to offset customer privacy concerns. Nevertheless, the impact of perceived quality on personalization usage is weaker for customers who have experienced privacy invasion in the past. The results show that customers who are likely to use online personalization are also likely to pay for the service. This finding suggests that, despite privacy concerns, there is an opportunity for businesses to monetize high-quality personalization.

In this scientific article, methods of document analysis, scientific literature review, case study and generalization are used. Consumers themselves decide how much and what kind of information to publicize on the Facebook social network.

By algorithms we mean predictive models (decision rules) captured from historical data using data mining. Such models often decide prices we pay, select ads we see and news we read online, match job descriptions and candidate CVs, decide who gets a loan, who goes through an extra airport security check, or who gets released on parole. Yet growing evidence suggests that decision making by algorithms may discriminate people, even if the computing process is fair and well-intentioned. This happens due to biased or non-representative learning data in combination with inadvertent modeling procedures. From the regulatory perspective there are two tendencies in relation to this issue: (1) to ensure that data-driven decision making is not discriminatory, and (2) to restrict overall collecting and storing of private data to a necessary minimum. This paper shows that from the computing perspective these two goals are contradictory. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically with standard regression models that in order to make sure that decision models are non-discriminatory, for instance, with respect to race, the sensitive racial information needs to be used in the model building process. Of course, after the model is ready, race should not be required as an input variable for decision making. From the regulatory perspective this has an important implication: collecting sensitive personal data is necessary in order to guarantee fairness of algorithms, and law making needs to find sensible ways to allow using such data in the modeling process.","","14.13:COMPUTERS,2600:Management science/operations research,4320:Legislation,5200:Communications {\&} information management,9130:Experimental/theoretical,Airport security,Airports,Algorithms,Analysis,Computation,Computer information security,Computers--Artificial Intelligence,Data mining,Decision making,Fairness,Finland,Legislation,Modelling,Netherlands,Non-discrimination,Personal data,Personal information,Race,Regression,Regression models,Sensitive data,Studies","",""

It is a fairly simple technology involving radio wave communication between a microchip and an electronic reader, in which an identification number stored on the chip is transmitted and processed; it can frequently be found in inventory tracking and access control systems. In this paper, we examine the current uses of RFID, as well as identifying potential future uses of the technology, including item-level tagging, human implants and RFID-chipped passports, while discussing the impacts that each of these uses could potentially have on personal privacy. Possible guidelines for RFID's use, including Fair Information Principles and the RFID Bill of Rights are then presented, as well as technological solutions to personal privacy problems, such as tag killing and blocker tags, as well as simple aluminum foil shields for passports. It is then claimed, though, that guidelines and technological solutions will be ineffective for privacy protection, and that legislation will be necessary to guard against the threats posed by the RFID. Finally, we present what we believe to be the most important legislative points that must be addressed.

To minimize the damage and influence of the privacy disclosure, the important and sensitive privacy should be a priori preserved if all privacy pieces cannot be preserved. This paper focuses on studying the attributes of the privacy and proposes privacy information security classification (PISC) model. The privacy is classified into four security classifications by PISC, and each classification has its security goal, respectively.

In this article, we report the findings of a project in which we used cultural probes to generate discussion about personal digital dataveillance. Our findings suggest the prevailing dominance of tacit assumptions about the uses and benefits of dataveillance as well as fears and anxieties about its possible misuse. Participants were able to identify a range of ways in which dataveillance is conducted, but were more aware of obvious commercial and some government actors. There was very little identification of the types of dataveillance that are used by national security and policing agencies or of illegal access by hackers and cybercriminals. We found that the participants recognised the value of both personal data and the big aggregated data sets that their own data may be part of, particularly for their own convenience. However, they expressed concern or suspicion about how these data may be used by others, often founded on a lack of knowledge about what happens to their data. The major question for our participants was where the line should be drawn. When does personal dataveillance become too intrusive, scary or creepy? What are its drawbacks and risks? Our findings suggest that experimenting with innovative approaches to elicit practices and understandings of personal digital data offers further possibilities for greater depth and breadth of social research with all types of social groups.","","1653:social control; police, penology, {\&} correctional problems,Aggregate level data,Big Data,Bioethics,Civil rights,Data,Dominance,Government agencies,Hacking,Illegal,National security,Policing,Public spaces,Qualitative research,Scandals,Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works,Social groups,Social networks,Social research,Society,Sociology,State laws,Web 2.0","",""

Just as Asian genomes are under-represented in PM, the views of Asian populations about the risks and benefits of data sharing are under-represented in prior attitudinal research. Methods We conducted seven focus groups with 62 participants in Singapore from May to July 2019. They were conducted in three languages (English, Mandarin and Malay) and analysed with qualitative content and thematic analysis. Results Four key themes emerged: nuanced understandings of data security and data sensitivity; trade-offs between data protection and research benefits; trust (and distrust) in the public and private sectors; and governance and control options. Participants were aware of the inherent risks associated with data sharing for research. Participants expressed conditional support for data sharing, including genomic sequence data and information contained within electronic medical records. This support included sharing data with researchers from universities and healthcare institutions, both in Singapore and overseas. Support was conditional on the perceived social value of the research and appropriate de-identification and data security processes. Participants suggested that a data sharing oversight body would help strengthen public trust and comfort in data research for PM in Singapore. Conclusion Maintenance of public trust in data security systems and governance regimes can enhance participation in PM and data sharing for research. Contrary to themes in much prior research, participants demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the inherent risks of data sharing, analysed trade-offs between risks and potential benefits of PM, and often adopted an international perspective.","","Biobanks,Bioethics,Data integrity,Data sharing,Ethics,Genomics,Governance,Information sharing,Initiatives,Medical research,Patients,Philosophy,Precision medicine,Privacy,Public attitudes,Public trust,Qualitative research,Singapore,United States--US","",""

However, given the power and value of both the raw data and the derived knowledge, to ensure that the generators are commensurate beneficiaries, we advocate an open approach to the data and intellectual property rights by treating user-generated content, as well as derived information and knowledge, as a common-pool resource. In this paper, we undertake an extensive review of experimental, commercial and social participatory sensory applications, from which we identify that a decentralised, community-oriented governance model is required to support this approach. Furthermore, we show that Ostrom's institutional analysis and development framework, in conjunction with a framework for self-organising electronic institutions, can be used to give both an architecture and algorithmic base for the requisite governance model, in terms of operational and collective-choice rules specified in computational logic. This provides, we believe, the foundations for engineering knowledge commons for the next generation of participatory-sensing applications, in which the data generators are also the primary beneficiaries.","","Computers--Computer Systems,Conflict resolution,Knowledge,Management","",""

Despite the importance of understanding the nature of online consumers' concerns for information privacy, this topic has received little attention in the information systems community. To fill the gap in the literature, this article focuses on three distinct, yet closely related, issues. First, drawing on social contract theory, we offer a theoretical framework on the dimensionality of Internet users' information privacy concerns (IUIPC). Second, we attempt to operationalize the multidimensional notion of IUIPC using a second-order construct, and we develop a scale for it. Third, we propose and test a causal model on the relationship between IUIPC and behavioral intention toward releasing personal information at the request of a marketer. We conducted two separate field surveys and collected data from 742 household respondents in one-on-one, face-to-face interviews. The results of this study indicate that the second-order IUIPC factor, which consists of three first-order dimensions - namely, collection, control, and awareness - exhibited desirable psychometric properties in the context of online privacy. In addition, we found that the causal model centering on IUIPC fits the data satisfactorily and explains a large amount of variance in behavioral intention, suggesting that the proposed model will serve as a useful tool for analyzing online consumers' reactions to various privacy threats on the Internet.

While, in the face of ever-increasing competition, there is pressure on the executive to find out more about the organization's customer, the key question here is, "How much is enough?" A greater threat is the process by which the data "travels". From these issues, another grave danger which comes out is that of manipulation of the customer. The executive having insights into the customer's behavior offers certain cues, eg, a bundling of offerings which the customer has bought in conjunction earlier. This paper gives an overview of ethics first, including a couple of generic theoretical frameworks useful for business decision making.

Furthermore, it examines the implications of the Directive on the economic sector of the European Union, by focusing on the Directive's impact on EU competitiveness and other EU policies such as the Lisbon Strategy. This analysis is motivated by the following questions: what are the monetary costs of creating and maintaining the proposed database for data retention? What are the effects of these measures on individuals? What obstacles arise for the global competitiveness of EU telecommunications and electronic communications service providers as a result of these measures? Are other policies in the European Union affected by this measure? If so, which ones?

Although a coherent subset of research themes provide deep understanding, theoretical and empirical findings show this narrow focus also has constrained our view of privacy to consumer, organizational, ethical, or legal silos. In response, we take a necessary step toward expanding the privacy domain across these borders, emphasizing the compelling synergies that span multiple interests. We conclude by highlighting future research themes that embody a multidimensional approach, which blends the many interconnected concerns that feature in contemporary privacy questions in marketing.

However, use diffusion of these products is hampered by consumers' lack of trust toward smart products. Accordingly, trust must be built in smart products before companies (and society) can tap the full economic potential of these products. The present review of articles investigates various factors that might influence this process. We classify these factors into several categories: control, transparency, security and protection, product performance, product handling, brand, as well as onboarding and information. Furthermore, we account for the relevance of these factors in three of the primary fields in which smart products are currently available: smart homes, mobility, as well as entertainment and communication. The review concludes that consumer control over smart, autonomous products has a significant impact across all three fields with regard to establishing a fundamental level of trust. Additional trust can be created through, for example, onboarding and information features, which help users to learn about smart solutions and their behavior.","","Business And Economics--Management,Consumer goods,Consumer trust,Literature review,Literature reviews,M30 (Marketing and Advertising: General),O33 (Innovation: Technological Change),Orientations,Smart product,Trust,Trust-building factors","",""

In recent years, alongside these public health tools, commercial mobile apps such as Sickweather have also been released. Sickweather collects information from across the web, as well as self-reports from users, so that people can see who is sick in their neighborhood. The purpose of this paper is to examine the privacy and surveillance implications of digital disease tracking tools.Design/methodology/approachThe author performed a content and platform analysis of two apps, Sickweather and HealthMap, by using them for three months, taking regular screenshots and keeping a detailed user journal. This analysis was guided by the walkthrough method and a cultural-historical activity theory framework, taking note of imagery and other content, but also the app functionalities, including characteristics of membership, “rules” and parameters of community mobilization and engagement, monetization and moderation. This allowed me to study HealthMap and Sickweather as modes of governance that allow for (and depend upon) certain actions and particular activity systems.FindingsDraw on concepts of network power, the surveillance assemblage, and Deleuze's control societies, as well as the data gathered from the content and platform analysis, the author argues that disease tracking apps construct disease threat as omnipresent and urgent, compelling users to submit personal information – including sensitive health data – with little oversight or regulation.Originality/valueDisease tracking mobile apps are growing in popularity yet have received little attention, particularly regarding privacy concerns or the construction of disease risk.","","Analytics,Applications programs,Big Data,Community relations,Computers--Internet,Crowdsourcing,Data,Data mining,Disease tracking,Epidemics,Imagery,Infectious diseases,Mobile apps,Mobile computing,Privacy,Public health,Social networks,Surveillance,Surveillance medicine,Tools,Tracking,User generated content,Web sites","",""

Society's prevalent use of interconnected    devices enables companies to collect and manipulate users' personal data    for their own monetary benefits. While the law grapples with how best to    protect users from such privacy risks, another significant danger has    emerged: by besting the often-weak security measures employed by    companies that create interconnected devices, hackers can compromise the    integrity of these electronics by remotely accessing them. This allows    hackers to gain unauthorized access to the personal data of users and    potentially hold their devices for ransom.    Smart devices are constantly evolving, and the risk that their users'    personal information will be misused is increasing. However, Ontario law    has been slow to acknowledge the possibility for individuals to obtain    damages for breaches of their privacy. To date, Ontario courts have only    recognized two invasion of privacy torts: the Intrusion Upon Seclusion    and the Public Disclosure of Private Facts, both of which are very    limited in scope.    The aim of this paper is to examine whether these torts are sufficiently    broad to address the privacy breaches that have become commonplace in    our digital world. After outlining the privacy violations to which users    of the Internet of Things are exposed, this paper will examine the    potential of applying the Intrusion and Public Disclosure torts to such    practices in an attempt to determine if users might be successful in    obtaining monetary redress for such violations in a manner that the    privacy legislation has been unable to achieve. This paper will then    analyze whether or not these same torts might be used to impose    liability on the companies responsible for personal information or    devices that were breached by hackers. Finally, suggestions for how    Ontario privacy law should evolve to better address our technologically    enhanced reality will be explored.}","","","",""

The conceptual model includes four variables: security concerns, perceived risk of cyberattacks, perceived government cybersecurity preparedness and e-services avoidance. Data from 774 participants were used to analyze our conceptual model.FindingsFirst, the findings show that security concerns regarding personal information safety and perceived risk of cyberattacks are barriers to e-services use, with the former having a stronger effect. Second, the findings showed that perceived government cybersecurity preparedness significantly reduces security concerns and perceived risk of cyberattacks. Third, the post hoc group analysis between individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher versus those without a bachelor's degree showed that the effect of both security concerns and perceived risk of cyberattacks on e-services avoidance was greater for individuals without a bachelor's degree.

First, an account of privacy is offered that clarifies the concept and demonstrates how privacy is directly related to human health and well-being.

However, scholars have noted that the acceptance and utilisation of e-government systems by citizens in Zimbabwe and Zambia is affected by many factors, among others, perceived privacy, perceived security, perceived trust, perceived risk and optimism bias. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of privacy, security, trust, optimism bias and perceived risk on citizens' use behaviour of e-government systems in the SADC. Method: This study proposes an e-government utilisation model. A quantitative design was employed to collect data from a survey of 489 e-government users in Zambia and Zimbabwe to test the model fit using structural equation modelling. Results: Perceived lack of privacy, security, trust; perceived risk and optimism bias were all confirmed as salient factors affecting the utilisation of e-government systems by citizens in Zambia and Zimbabwe. The structural equation model results confirmed the model fit of the proposed e-government research model. All eight hypotheses for this study were confirmed. Conclusion: The findings of this study provide pointers to practitioners, decision-makers and policymakers on e-government matters on the need to seriously consider privacy, security, risk and trust issues of e-government systems to encourage the utilisation of such systems by citizens.","","Bias,Business And Economics--Management,Decision making,Electronic government,Perceptions,Privacy,SADC,User behavior,Zambia,Zimbabwe,e-government,security-concerns,use behaviour","",""

They control police access to driver's licenses, educational records, health histories, telephone calls, email messages, and even video rentals. They conform to no common template, but rather enlist a variety of procedural tools to serve as safeguards -- ranging from warrants and court orders to subpoenas and demand letters. But across this remarkable diversity, there is one feature that all these statutes share in common: each contains a provision exempting law enforcement from its general terms. Despite the appearance of law enforcement exemptions in every generally applicable privacy statute on the federal books, they have garnered virtually no scholarly attention.","","1210:Politics {\&} political behavior,9190:United States,Amendments,Criminal justice,Law,Law enforcement,Privacy,United States--US","",""

Our study revealed a shift in policy over time from a rigid to a more collaborative approach to regulation. From the 1980s to the 2000s, security control measures were developed to prevent leakage of personal data to external entities, using methods such as anonymisation, which can be applied in a linkable or unlinkable fashion. However, by the 2010s, de-identification measures have been introduced. They make it possible to utilise personal data that is de-identified (not completely, but specific individuals cannot be easily identified) in certain types of genomic research. This also involved the establishment of an independent data protection authority that controls the utilisation of data in collaboration with other stakeholders. Through this process, bioethics policy has become an established science and technology policy in Japan; and in recent years, bioethics policy has also gained relevance in areas outside the life sciences.","","Bioethics,Bioethics policy,Biology--Biotechnology,Collaboration,Genomes,Human genome research,Japan,Life sciences,Personal data,Science and technology policy","",""

What we forgot to take into account was another very great danger to humans. The pervasiveness of computer technology, without appropriate security safeguards, dehumanises us by allowing criminals to steal not just our money but also our confidential and private data at will. Also, denial-of-service attacks prevent us from accessing the information we need when we want it. We are being dehumanised not by the technology but by criminals who use the ubiquity of the technology and its lack of security to steal from us and prevent us from doing what we want. What is more interesting is that this malevolent use of the technology doesn't come from monolithic corporate structures eager to control our lives but mainly from individuals keen to demonstrate their knowledge of the technology for social networking purposes. The aim of this paper is to turn the clock back 25 years and present an alternative perspective: the single, biggest threat of dehumanisation is not the pervasiveness and ubiquity of computers but the lack of ensuring that humans are provided with the basic security they need for using the technology safely and securely. Cyberspace is not a safe space to be. This was something that even far-sighted researcher colleagues in the 1970s and 1980s overlooked. The paper will explore where we went wrong 25 years ago in our predictions and concerns.

Studies show that individuals are concerned about database privacy; yet, they seldom make privacy a salient attribute when deciding among competing alternatives. Although privacy policies are present on many Web sites, Web users rarely bother to read them. Professor Nehf explores why this is so, identifying rational reasons why Web users do not shop for privacy and discussing the implications for the expanding market for consumer information. Unless privacy becomes a salient attribute influencing consumer choice, Web site operators will continue to obtain and use more personal information than Web users would choose to provide in a more transparent exchange. In a responding commentary, Professors Pitt and Watson use an ecosystem approach that explores the multiple dimensions of privacy. Investigating the interactions between the three major players-citizen/consumer/investor, government, and corporation-they identify reasons for the failure of market mechanisms to arise to protect privacy.

They also show that costs will result if the global economy has to function on the basis of distrust, both at the individual and transaction level. Although the Internet has transformed the economy, society and politics, it was never designed and built for global, ubiquitous and secure commercial use. While the technology is new, the need for trust, confidence and security remains. The Internet is an open network where there is no outside body that can administer sanctions. In this respect, it appears to be unique in commercial history. One characteristic of the public Internet is that, since it consists of many thousands of autonomous networks spanning a large number of jurisdictions, it has no well defined oversight mechanism that can administer sanctions. Drawing upon the lessons of history and historical analogies, the authors indicate some possible solutions. For the Internet to achieve its maximum social and political potential there will have to be agreed upon and effective rules of the road, both nationally and globally.

They provide evidence for the so-called privacy paradox which describes that people's intentions, with regard to privacy, differ from their actual behavior.

Furthermore, a large majority of library websites included in the study have implemented Google Analytics and/or Google Tag Manager, yet only very few connect securely to Google via HTTPS or have implemented Google Analytics IP anonymization.Practical implicationsLibrarians are encouraged to increase awareness of this issue and take concerted and coherent action across five interrelated areas: implementing secure web protocols (HTTPS), user education, privacy policies, informed consent and risk/benefit analyses.Originality/valueThird-party tracking of users is prevalent across the web, and yet few studies demonstrate its extent and consequences for academic library websites.","","Academic libraries,Advertising,Computers--Internet,Encryption,Home pages,Informed consent,Libraries,Library associations,Mathematical analysis,Privacy,Tracking,User behavior,Web analytics,Web sites,Websites","",""

However, such personalization comes at a price - a threat to privacy. Two diametrically opposed philosophies to privacy protection exist - the self-regulation approach epitomized by the United States, or the legislative approach mandated by the European Union. These are contrasted, and an analysis of international practices highlights how the latter approach has been adopted as the de-facto worldwide standard. Compliance with this standard by the major international hotel companies is then assessed by critically analyzing the websites of the top 50 hotel companies. Findings indicate that while hotel websites frequently include statements outlining what data is being collected and how it is being used, few give consumers any option as to the secondary use of their data, nor the right to modify or remove data from databases. Tests were also carried out to establish whether companies subsequently delivered their promises. With few exceptions, most behaved ethically, indicating a degree of maturity in terms of customer data use absent from other sectors.

While the United States generally favors self-regulation, the European Community has taken the more restrictive legislative approach, which extends to all who wish to use European customer data. An examination of the Web sites hosted by ninety-seven large hotel companies indicates that while sites frequently include statements outlining what data are being collected and how they are being used, none comply with all legislative requirements, in particular with regard to onward transfer, access to the data, and whether consumers have a choice in how their information is used.

However, such efforts are undermined by the large numbers of children who circumvent age restrictions and lie about their age to gain access to such platforms. This paper deals with the ethical issues that arise in this not-so-hypothetical situation. Who, for instance, bears responsibility for children's welfare in this context? Are parents/carers ethically culpable in failing to be sufficiently vigilant or even facilitating their children's social media use? Do industry providers do enough to enforce their own regulations and remove those users they know to be underage? How far does a duty of care extend? Regulation of age restrictions has, it is argued, created unintended consequences that heighten online dangers for young people. While children are inevitably drawn to new online spaces for entertainment and fun, should their rights to participate in the social world around them be curtailed to ensure their best interests and those of the wider community? Such questions now pose significant practical and ethical dilemmas for policy makers and other stakeholders involved in internet governance. It especially highlights the question of responsibility for protection of minors online and calls into question whether the current model of shared responsibility is working.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","","1220:Social trends {\&} culture,2410:Social responsibility,4310:Regulation,5250:Telecommunications systems {\&} Internet communications,8331:Internet services industry,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9190:United States,Children {\&} youth,Ethics,Internet,Minors,Online information services,Philosophy,Privacy,Self regulation,Social networks,Social responsibility,Studies,United States--US","",""

These devices have gained crucial importance in our life.    Hereby, we are entering into a new era, one in which the Internet of    Thing (IoT) will replace the traditional Internet that we know today.    Although IoT is expected to have a massive impact on individuals, it is    still in its early days and many challenges lie ahead.    As consumers and users of connected smart devices, we focus to such an    extent on the incredible functionality of IoT that we often forget to    think about the possible implications for our private life and security.    Many questions arise about the vulnerability of these devices, which are    often installed outside of a traditional IT structure, without    integrated security attributes. Thus, expected benefits must take into    account the challenges especially related to privacy and security that    IoT may pose. Data loss, malware, unauthorized access to personal data,    intrusive use or illegal surveillance are risks that need to be    addressed. Beyond compliance with legal and technical norms, there are    important implications that IoT has on society, in general, and on    consumer, in particular.    This paper is motivated by the above considerations, providing insight    into challenges and opportunities of IoT related to consumer. Through    reviewing the literature, the article firstly clarifies the significance    of this concept and then discusses the applications of IoT related to    individual consumer, highlighting those processes and activities that    can be dramatically changed by IoT and the wide range of challenges    faced by these networks.}","","","",""

To achieve this, this research identifies what could be the influence factors in the adoption of mobile applications with Location Based Services from the point of view of the tourism sector, especially if the social and environmental benefits of LBS can help improve usage behavior. We investigated the technological acceptance of LBS in tourism, using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as a solid model to explain its adoption. Nine hypotheses were investigated by carrying out a survey of travelers (n = 277) during their visit to Seville (Spain). To test the conceptual model's hypotheses, the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique was applied to estimate variance-based structural equations models (SEM).The results of this study indicated that tourists are willing to accept these LBS services within a particular adoption model, where trust in privacy and social and environmental benefits are paramount.","","Applications programs,Environmental Studies,Hypotheses,Location based services,Location-based services,Mathematical models,Mobile computing,Privacy,Social behavior,Sustainable development,Technology Acceptance Model,Technology utilization,Tourism,Tourists","",""

In our second experiment, we examine the effects of different forms of privacy disclosures. The results suggest that online shoppers find a short, straightforward privacy statement more comprehensible than a lengthy, legalistic one. However, how a privacy policy is presented (in terms of wording) does not affect a shopper's trust in the store to any significant degree.

Rapid development of ubiquitous computing and 'the internet of things' are leading to Big Data and the application of Predictive Analytics, effectively merging the real world with cyberspace. The power of information technology is increasingly used to provide personalised services to citizens, leading to the availability of huge amounts of sensitive data about individuals, with potential and actual privacy-eroding effects. To protect the private sphere, deemed essential in a state of law, information and communication systems (ICTs) should meet the requirements laid down in numerous privacy regulations. Sensitive personal information may be captured by organizations, provided that the person providing the information consents to the information being gathered, and may only be used for the express purpose the information was gathered for. Any other use of information about persons without their consent is prohibited by law; notwithstanding legal exceptions. If regulations are properly translated into written code, they will be part of the outcomes of an ICT, and that ICT will therefore be privacy compliant. We conclude that privacy compliance in the 'technological' sense cannot meet citizens' concerns completely, and should therefore be augmented by a conceptual model to make privacy impact assessments at the level of citizens' lives possible.","","5200:Communications {\&} information management,9130:Experiment/theoretical treatment,Big Data,Business And Economics,Data analysis,Information management,Internet access,Privacy,Studies,Value chain","",""

In practice, though, for example in the case of on-line digital music, the needs of citizens and enterprises may be in conflict. This paper proposes to leverage the appearance of 'intelligence' in the platform layer of a layered communications architecture to avoid such conflicts in similar applications in the future. The key idea is that if the intelligence is encapsulated in an agent, then the agents should be organized as a society, and then the rules of the society can be used to ensure 'responsible' behaviour. We discuss how an agent society can be used to regulate behaviour in future information trading scenarios, and conclude that this approach offers a 'third way' which can satisfy the (reasonable) needs of both citizens and enterprises in the user-friendly information society.

This paper examines privacy policies from a linguistic angle to determine whether the language of these documents is adequate for communicating data-handling practices in a manner that enables informed consent on the part of the user. The findings highlight that corporate privacy policies obfuscate, enhance and mitigate unethical data handling practices and use persuasive appeals to increase companies{\&}rsquo; trustworthiness. The communicative strategies identified provide starting points for redesigning existing privacy statements with a view to communicating data handling practices in a more transparent and responsible manner, laying the groundwork for informed consent.

Nonetheless, because they do not occupy the high status positions that facilitate white-collar crimes, serious computer crimes by juveniles have fallen between the theoretical cracks. A new hybrid category of crime that we label "white-collar delinquency" demonstrates that class does matter in the way illegal activity is conceptualized, and re-ignites debates regarding both white-collar crime and juvenile delinquency. We review conceptual issues that relate to this emergent form of computer-based deviance, and identify questions to be addressed in future theorizing and research.

Moreover, another purpose is to critically address the underlying privacy concerns arising from smart city designs. Design/Methods/Approach: The paper is theoretical in scope and utilises a literature review as the basic method. Correlations between smart cities, policing and criminal investigations are identified by analysing the applicability of core smart city technologies and services [SCTS]. Findings: It is evident that SCTS can influence policing styles and police effectiveness. SCTS hold great potential for criminal investigations and criminal intelligence as they provide information upon which police can develop investigations or crime-control strategies. Vice-versa, criminal investigations and criminal intelligence can provide guidelines for SCTS developers and the governance of smart cities. However, privacy concerns and the slowly developing regulatory framework remain the biggest issues when it comes to SCTS adoption, thus making measures to safeguard privacy a key factor for the legitimacy of smart cities and smart policing. Practical Implications: The paper introduces practical knowledge about the implications of smart cities for policing and crime investigation. Some research ideas are presented as well as suggestions for legislators, developers and others whose work area falls in the scope of (smart) city governance. Originality/Value: A comprehensive study of the symbiosis between smart cities and policing must not only consider the potential of SCTS but the related need to develop regulation and skillsets of human resources. Only a handful of papers address the connectivity of smart cities, criminal investigations and criminal intelligence from such a multidisciplinary scope. Therefore, the paper represents a contribution to works discussing these concepts.Alternate abstract:Namen prispevka: Namen prispevka je predstaviti simbiozo med pametnimi mesti, policijsko dejavnostjo, kriminalisti{\v{c}}nim preiskovanjem in kriminalisti{\v{c}}noobve{\v{s}}{\v{c}}evalno dejavnostjo. V tem kontekstu je podan tudi kriti{\v{c}}ni razmislek o izzivih in dilemah, povezanih z varstvom zasebnosti. Metode: Prispevek je teoreti{\v{c}}ne narave in temelji na pregledu literature. Korelacije med temeljnimi pojmi (pametna mesta, policijska in kriminalisti{\v{c}}na dejavnost) smo identificirali z analizo temeljnih tehnologij, sistemov in storitev, ki podpirajo delovanje pametnih mest. Ugotovitve: Tehnologije pametnih mest omogo{\v{c}}ajo razvoj novih oblik policijskega dela in imajo potencial za izbolj{\v{s}}anje policijske u{\v{c}}inkovitosti. Funkcionalnost tehnologij je razvidna tudi na podro{\v{c}}ju kriminalisti{\v{c}}ne dejavnosti, ki lahko z obdelovanjem podatkov in njihovo uporabo bolje na{\v{c}}rtuje kriminalisti{\v{c}}ne preiskave in razvija strategije prepre{\v{c}}evanja kriminalitete. Simbioza je opazna tudi z nasprotnega vidika - s podajanjem smernic lahko kriminalisti{\v{c}}na in policijska dejavnost pomagata upravljavcem pametnih mest in razvojnikom tehnologij ter re{\v{s}}itev. Glavni izziv predstavlja varovanje zasebnosti in osebnih podatkov prebivalcev, zato so mehanizmi za prepre{\v{c}}evanje zlorab klju{\v{c}}ni faktor legitimnosti pametnih mest in policijske dejavnosti. Prakti{\v{c}}na uporabnost: V pr{\'{i}}spevku so predstavljena uporabna znanja glede potencialov pametnih mest za izvajanje policijske in kriminalisti{\v{c}}ne dejavnosti, prav tako tudi predlogi za raziskovalce in oblikovalce politik, razvojnike in druge, ki delujejo na podro{\v{c}}ju upravljanja (pametnih) mest. Izvirnost/pomembnost prispevka: {\v{C}}e {\v{z}}elimo razumeti sistem dejavnikov, ki vplivajo na simbiozo med policijsko dejavnostjo in pametnimi mesti, je treba upo{\v{s}}tevati ne samo potenciale razli{\v{c}}nih tehnologij in re{\v{s}}itev, temve{\v{c}} tudi potrebe in dileme, ki se pojavijo so{\v{c}}asno s tehnolo{\v{s}}kim razvojem, primarno na podro{\v{c}}ju razvoja kadrovskih kompetenc in prilagoditve normativnih okvirjev.

As part of the registration process, states request several highly sensitive pieces of information from individual voters. Voters may be required to disclose their name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, party affiliation, and more. States, in turn, compile this data and distribute it to third parties. This distribution of voter registration data has left the American populace exposed to identity theft, stalking, election manipulation, and more. This Note suggests Congress should pass a new federal statute to curtail the distribution of voter registration data. This statute would restrict who can access voter data, the purposes for which that data can be used, and what personal information can be distributed as part of a voter record. Additionally, the law would create a national Address Confidentiality Program to ensure domestic violence victims could cast a ballot without placing themselves in danger. Lastly, the statute would mandate new data security measures, so highly personal information does not make its way into the hands of people who might use it to wreak havoc.","","Constitutions,Data integrity,Election results,Identity theft,Law,Local elections,Mississippi,Personal information,Public officials,Voter behavior,Voter fraud,Voter registration,Voting rights","",""

This Act exempted employee records from privacy protection, and was justified by the Government on the ground that employee records protection was better addressed under workplace relations legislation. In February 2004, after much criticism of the exemption, the Government initiated a review of employee records privacy; the closing date for submissions was 16 April 2004. Since that time, the Howard Liberal-National Coalition Commonwealth rewrote industrial relations legislation, excluding any reference to employee records. In addition, there has been a lack of papers published since the 2004 inquiry despite heightened activity by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner; the exception being the recent review undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) (2007).

It is also conducted to identify the gaps in the cybersecurity awareness assessment research which warrants the future work. Design/methodology/approach – The authors used a systematic literature review technique to search the relevant online databases by using pre-defined keywords. The authors limited the search to retrieve only English language academic articles published from 2000 to 2014. Relevant information was extracted from the retrieved articles, and the ensuing discussion centres on providing the answers to the research questions. Findings – From the online searches, 14 studies that matched the search criteria were retrieved, and the information extracted from each study includes the authors, publication year, assessment method used, target audiences, coverage of assessment and assessment goals. Originality/value – The review of the retrieved articles indicates that no previous research was conducted in the assessment of the cybersecurity awareness using a programme evaluation technique. It was also found that few studies focused on youngsters and on the issue of safeguarding personal information.","","Adaptation,Audiences,Computer security,Computers--Cybernetics,Cybernetics,English language,Information retrieval,Internet access,Literature reviews,Methods,Personal computers,Researchers,Searching,Security management,Social networks,Social research,Virtual communities","",""

Cybercrime includes theft, fraud, misdirection of communication, identity theft, intellectual property theft, corporate espionage, system sabotage, data destruction, money laundering, and terrorism.3 Some of the main categories of threats from cybercrime include computer system intrusion for monetary or other benefit, manipulation of information or networks, data destruction, misuse of processing power, counterfeit items, or interception for espionage.4 Most often, these types of schemes are carried out by someone without authorized access to a computer system.  Phishing, Smishing, and Vishing Scams "Phishing" describes a scheme when a cybercriminal sends a fake email message requesting the recipient to click on a link or respond with requested personal information.5 The email address of the sender often appears to be a legitimate address, such as that of a bank or other organization with access to personal information.6 "Smishing" and "vishing" are similar schemes accomplished through SMS texting and phone calls where the criminals send text messages or call potential victims and pretend to be someone with legitimate access to the victims' personal information.7 Victims who respond then provide their personal information. 2.","","Computer viruses,Espionage,Fraud,Hackers,Identity theft,Insurance coverage,Internet crime,Law,Malware,Personal information,Pittsburgh Pennsylvania,Structured Query Language-SQL,Text messaging,Third party,United States--US","",""

Last updated - 2019-06-04","In 2018, it became public knowledge that millions of Facebook users ' data had been harvested without their consent. At the heart of the issue was Cambridge Analytica (CA) which in partnership with Cambridge researcher, Aleksandr Kogan harvested data from millions of Facebook profiles. Kogan had developed an application called "thisisyourdigitallife " which featured a personality quiz and CA paid for people to take it. The app recorded results of each quiz, collected data from quiz taker's Facebook account such as personal information and Facebook activity (e.g., what content was "liked") as well as their Facebook friends which led to data harvesting of about 87 million Facebook profiles. The researcher then passed on this data to CA, which then used an algorithm that enabled them to psychologically profile people based on their Facebook interactions. Donald Trump had hired CA as a part of his 2016 Presidential election strategy. In order to deliver pro-Trump materials to individuals online, CA targeted individuals with a lesser known Facebook feature called "dark post" that contains personalized ads that are visible only to targeted individuals.CA consciously exploited fears of individuals with targeted advertising based on their personality profiles. The use of highly personalized ads made them vulnerable to Trump's messages that compelled them to vote for him. This digital onslaught played a significant role in Trump's victory over Hilary Clinton. This article will review how CA was able to harvest users' personal data and what were its repercussions.","","Data integrity,Library And Information Sciences,Personal information,Personality,Political campaigns,Privacy,Researchers,Social networks,Whistleblowing","",""

In light of the shortcomings of the government, industry and consumers in protecting anonymity, it is clear that a new perspective for ensuring anonymity is needed. Where current stakeholders have failed to protect anonymity, some proponents argue that economic models exist for valuation of anonymity. By placing a monetary value on anonymity through Rawls' concept of primary goods, it is possible to create a marketplace for anonymity, therefore allowing users full control of how their personal data is used. This paper aims to explore the creation of a data marketplace, offering users the possibility of engaging with companies and other entities to sell and auction personal data. Importantly, participation in a marketplace does not sacrifice one's anonymity, as there are different levels of anonymity in online systems.Design/methodology/approachThe paper uses a conceptual framework based on the abstractions of anonymity and data valuation.FindingsThe manuscript constructs a conceptual foundation for exploring the development and deployment of a personal data marketplace. By suggesting features allowing individuals' control of their personal data, and properly establishing monetary valuation of one's personal data, it is argued that individuals will undertake a more proactive management of personal data.Originality/valueAn overview of the available services and products offering increased anonymity is explored, in turn, illustrating the beginnings of a market response for anonymity as a valuable good. By placing a monetary value on individuals' anonymity, it is reasoned that individuals will more consciously protect their anonymity in ways where legislation and other practices (i.e. privacy policies, marketing opt-out) have failed.","","Anonymity,Auctions,Communications,Companies,Consumers,Economic analysis,Economic models,Foundation construction,Interest groups,Internet,Legislation,Marketing,On-line systems,Participation,Personal information,Privacy,Social networks,Stakeholders,Studies,United States--US,Valuation,Valuation methods,Value,Viability","",""

However, there is currently little awareness of public views about such research. The authors sought to explore attitudes of the public, and their lay representatives, towards the use of primary care medical record data for research when patient consent was not being sought.   Methods:  49 members of the public and four non-medical members of local community health councils in South Wales, UK gave their views on the value and acceptability of three current research scenarios, each describing access to data without patient consent.   Results:  Among focus group participants, awareness of research in primary care was low, and the appropriateness of general practitioners as researchers was questioned. There was general support for research but also concerns expressed about data collection without consent. These included lack of respect and patient control over the process. Unauthorised access to data by external agencies was a common fear. Current data collection practices, including population based disease registers elicited much anxiety. The key informants were equally critical of the scenarios and generally less accepting.   Conclusions:  This exploratory study has highlighted a number of areas of public concern when medical records are accessed for research without patient consent. Public acceptability regarding the use of medical records in research cannot simply be assumed. Further work is required to determine how widespread such views are and to inform those advising on confidentiality issues.","","Attitudes,Community,Confidentiality,Consent,Councils,Focus groups,General practice / family medicine,Interviews,Legal and forensic medicine,Medical Sciences,Medical research,Meetings,Public health,Researchers,Studies,United Kingdom--UK,confidentiality,data protection,informed consent,medical records,public opinion","",""

An important final component of this process is the archiving of the trial documents. Unfortunately, this is an often neglected function that is dealt with as an afterthought. Despite this, archiving is a legal and regulatory requirement that should be planned and carried out with the same attention to detail as every other aspect of the trial. It can also be a very labor intensive and expensive exercise. In this article what exactly is meant by archiving, what needs to be done to archive, and how it should be executed will be examined. We will focus on the practicalities and will draw upon our experience of archiving large clinical trials in the United Kingdom.   Within the context of clinical research, archiving is the safe and secure storage of essential documents. In the United Kingdom, these documents are those that throughout a clinical trial have demonstrated the compliance of the investigator, sponsor, and monitor with the standards of Good Clinical Practice and with The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Amendment Regulations 2006.1 These essential documents, and therefore their safe storage, are the only means that can be used to reconstruct the study after its completion, enabling the information contained in the final report to be verified.   Duration. Essential documents must now be retained by the investigator or sponsor for a minimum of five years after trial completion. This has increased from two to five years although the industry standard is still 10 to 15 years, and beyond for some products.1 Some documents may need to be retained for longer if it is specified in the contract between sponsor and investigator. For example, in the United Kingdom, general practice files are retained for 10 years after death, hospital files are kept for seven years, and the medical files of members of the armed forces and prisoners are kept indefinitely. Maternity records are kept for 25 years after the last Uve birth and oncology records are retained for 30 years, as are all blood transfusion records.2 Individual research organizations, hinders, and journals may also have their own policies for archiving trial documents, in particular in relation to the duration of archiving.3   When planning, it is important to identify which of the many different types of trial paperwork and other forms of documentation are to be archived.

The types of data available for consumer purchase seem likely to expand over the next few years. This trend invites the emergence of a new type of privacy harm, "relational control "-the influence that a person can exert on another in their social or professional networks using covertly acquired private information. U.S. privacy laws do not protect consumers from the possibility of relational control. Moreover, few scholars have proposed reforms broad enough to address this problem.

We highlight the many developments in the digitizing society that appear to be at odds with six recurring themes revealing from our analysis of the scientific literature on the dominant technologies: privacy, autonomy, security, human dignity, justice, and balance of power. This study shows that the new wave of digitization is putting pressure on these public values. In order to effectively shape the digital society in a socially and ethically responsible way, stakeholders need to have a clear understanding of what such issues might be. Supervision has been developed the most in the areas of privacy and data protection. For other ethical issues concerning digitization such as discrimination, autonomy, human dignity and unequal balance of power, the supervision is not as well organized.","","Augmented reality,Autonomy,Balance of power,Biometrics,Data integrity,Digital technology,Digitization,Ethics,ICT,Philosophy,Privacy,Public values,Technology,Virtual reality","",""

As a result, the laissez-faire perspective on regulating the internet and data collection has fallen to the wayside as efforts to protect consumer data through regulation gain international traction. Leading in the charge to protect consumers' personal information is the European Union with its passage of the General Data Protection Regulation, which went into full force May 2018. Following suit, and central to this Comment, is California's recent passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Generally, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request that businesses disclose to the consumer what personal information is being collected or sold by the business. Subject to some limitations, consumers may also request the business refrain from selling their personal data or delete their personal information. The Act further establishes requirements for companies with respect to their management of private user data, and it provides civil penalties and a private right of action for certain violations and breaches. This Comment examines whether it is the job of individual state legislatures or Congress to enact legislation for the purpose of protecting consumer data. This Comment analyzes how the First Amendment, preemption, and the Dormant Commerce Clause come into conflict with the CCPA. The benefits and the drawbacks of empowering states to act as laboratories for democracy are also examined. This Comment articulates the view that one robust and comprehensive federal law should be enacted and have preemptive effect. The federal government can provide important data protection and privacy thresholds, and states should have the flexibility to provide additional enforcement mechanisms to meet their local needs.","","California,Consent,Consumer protection,Consumers,Data collection,Data integrity,Education,Europe,General Data Protection Regulation,Internet,Legislation,Personal information,Privacy,Scandals,Social networks,Software,United States--US","",""

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization has detected a dramatic increase in the number of cyber-attacks. For instance, in Italy the COVID-19 emergency has heavily affected cybersecurity; from January to April 2020, the total of attacks, accidents, and violations of privacy to the detriment of companies and individuals has doubled. Using a systematic and rigorous approach, this paper aims to analyze the literature on the cyber risk in the healthcare sector to understand the real knowledge on this topic. The findings highlight the poor attention of the scientific community on this topic, except in the United States.

The latest examples of such regulation are state and federal laws that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving their personal information. These laws, proposed in the wake of highly publicized data spills, seek to punish the breached entity and to protect consumers by requiring the entity to notify its customers about the security breach. There are competing approaches, however, to how the law is to mandate release of information about data leaks. This Article finds that the current statutes' focus on reputational sanction is incomplete. An important function of breach notification is mitigation of harm after a data leak. This function requires a multiinstitutional coordinated response of the kind that is absent from current policy proposals. This Article advocates creation of a coordinated response architecture and develops the elements of such an approach. Central to this architecture is a coordinated response agent (CRA) that oversees steps for automatic consumer protection and heightens mitigation. This Article also proposes a bifurcated notice scheme that lets firms know that the CRA is watching and is scrutinizing their decision whether or not to disclose information about a breach to the affected individuals. Moreover, the CRA will set in motion automatic protective measures on behalf of the breached consumers.

The paper begins by reviewing briefly the role of surveillance and identifying the key issues of privacy, control and purpose of data collection and dissemination in an HR context. Through reviewing recent publications (1998-2004) contrasts are made between earlier and new processes in applicant attraction, search and assessment. The impact of these potential changes on privacy and equity is then examined for three stakeholders: applicants, organizations, and testers. The paper identifies the potential for misuse of data through these systems and the possibility of the perpetuation of discrimination for traditional marginalized groups. It raises the increased power brought about through such processes for organizations through data assemblage and for testers via increased control of their tools.","","5240:Software {\&} systems,6100:Human resource planning,9130:Experiment/theoretical treatment,9175:Western Europe,Business And Economics--Management,Data collection,Employees,Equality,Equity,Invasion of privacy,Recruitment,Studies,Surveillance,United Kingdom--UK","",""

Organizations increasingly rely on digital data to drive their growth and they are interconnected in a complex web to a multitude of stakeholders.Design/methodology/approachIn this paper, cybersecurity is defined, and cybersecurity assurance model is explained based on the relevant literature. In addition, the role of internal auditing is introduced within this new business landscape. Finally, recommendations are made to provide best practices for stakeholders.FindingsThere are four major cyber-focused standards and frameworks in the current literature, namely, Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology, International Organization for Standardization, The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and National Institute of Standards and Technology. In addition, there are many mechanisms in existence and operation currently which support cybersecurity assurance to prevent major threats. These include risk assessment, risk treatment, risk management, security assurance and auditing.Research limitations/implicationsCyber risk is not something that can be avoided; instead, it must be managed. Hence, it is very important to maintain formal documentation on related cyber controls. Internal audit should be an integral part of cybersecurity assurance process, as internal audit have a unique position to look across organizations. The contribution of internal audit also provides comfort to the Board and Audit Committee.Practical implicationsA model is introduced how the internal audit and information security functions could work together to support organizations accomplish a cost-effective level of information security. The key issues and approaches are explained for how to become a trusted cybersecurity advisor and a sample cybersecurity awareness program checklist is provided at Appendix 1.Social implicationsConsidering cybersecurity threats grow with speed, complexity, and impact, organizations are no longer satisfied with an answer to a question like “are we secure?” instead, they need the answer for such a question like “how to give a reasonable assurance that our business will be secure enough?”. In that respect, the role of internal audit is discussed based on the relevant literature and the current condition of the business environment.Originality/valueA model is introduced how the internal audit and information security functions could work together to support organizations accomplish a cost-effective level of information security.

However, such judicial and regulatory actions have often been haphazard, due in part to confusion over what constitute reasonable standards of cybersecurity care. This Article analyzes the emerging cybersecurity duty of care and examines the potential impact of the 2014 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework on shaping reasonable standards of cybersecurity. Given that cybersecurity best practices are not yet well defined, the NIST Framework has the potential to shape standards not only for critical infrastructure firms but also for the private sector writ large. Indeed, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in November 2013 wrote that it plans "to use an emerging framework of cybersecurity standards to assess and prioritize best practices... to address evolving cyber threats" in the telecommunications industry. Moreover, the NIST Framework has the potential to shift the cybersecurity landscape internationally, especially in jurisdictions that largely favor a voluntary approach to enhancing cybersecurity, including the United Kingdom, India, and to a lesser extent, the European Union. The uptake of the NIST Framework beyond the United States could help to foster a global standard of cybersecurity care, promoting consistency, benefitting businesses active across jurisdictions, and contributing to cyber peace.","","Computer security,Data encryption,Executives,Financial Services Modernization Act 1999-US,Health Insurance Portability {\&} Accountability Act,Infrastructure,Law--International Law,Liability,National security","",""

In order to generate recommendations, the service needs to access various types of user data such as previous product purchasing history, demographic and biographical information. However, users are sensitive to disclosure of personal information as it can be easily misused by malicious third parties. Consequently, there are unavoidable security concerns which will become known through attempted unauthorized access while providing the recommendation services. In order to protect against breaches of personal information, it is necessary to obfuscate the user information by means of an efficient encryption technique while simultaneously generating the recommendation by making true information inaccessible to the system. To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving recommender system using homomorphic encryption, by which the system can provide recommendations without knowing the actual ratings. Our approach is based on the ElGamal cryptosystem by which both addition and multiplication of plaintexts can be performed. The performance of the proposed scheme shows significantly high accuracy in-terms of computation and communication costs as well as outperforming other existing solutions.","","Computers--Computer Engineering,Data privacy,Encryption,Homomorphic encryption,Multiplication,Personal information,Privacy,Recommender systems","",""

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which enable these interactions, were originally built out of necessity but expanded in functionality as businesses matured. Some of the most familiar names on the Internet-Facebook, Amazon, Google-have long made APIs available to allow smaller players the chance to gain a foothold in a data marketplace controlled by a concentrated few. In turn, these platforms rose to prominence as the downstream success of these third parties using APIs generated upstream value for the provider via user traffic or valuable data. Increasingly, however, dominant platforms have begun closing off access to information and features by restricting APIs. This Article shows APIs are critical to Internet interoperability, which in turn fosters a truly competitive online marketplace. Conversely, overly restrictive APIs can amount to violations of competition law. However, this Article argues that while traditional antitrust is ill-suited to redress these harms, the Federal Trade Commission's Section 5 authorities are sufficiently flexible to fill the void. Given the political push to check "big tech" and the rise of Section 5 activity in data privacy, now is the time for the FTC to begin using this authority to monitor detrimental API designs.","","Access to information,Antitrust,Communication,Competition policy,Competitive advantage,Congressional investigations,Innovations,Internet,Interoperability,Law,Power,Privacy,Restaurants,Social networks,Software,Third party","",""

The SBIA defines a "breach of the security of the system" as unauthorized acquisition of computerized data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information. Because data security breach notification laws are a relatively recent phenomenon, a fair assessment of the effect of risk-based triggers must wait until courts have reviewed actual decisions not to report.

Legislators recognize that police hacking is highly intrusive to personal privacy but consider it justified by the increased use of encryption and mobile computing-both of which challenge traditional investigative methods. Police hacking also exemplifies a major challenge to the way legal systems deal with, and conceptualize, privacy. Existing conceptualizations of privacy and privacy rights do not always adequately address the types and degrees of intrusion into individuals' private lives that police hacking powers enable. Traditional privacy pillars such as the home and secrecy of communications do not always apply to computer-based police investigations in an era of mobile technologies and ubiquitous data. In this Article, we conduct a comparative legal analysis of criminal procedure rules in the United States, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom to see which privacy frameworks lawmakers and courts apply when regulating police hacking. We show that while classic privacy frames of inviolability of the home and secrecy of communications remain adequate for some forms of police hacking (observation and interception), they fail to capture novel and fundamentally different ways in which the most intrusive forms of police hacking (covert online searches and remote surveillance) impact privacy in twenty-first-century society.Alternate abstract:Our analysis shows the emergence of two new frameworks that have the potential to begin filling this void: 1) a container-based approach, focusing on the computer as protection-worthy in itself- or the "informatic home;" and 2) a content-based approach, focusing on the protection of data-or "informatic privacy." Since both approaches have valuable benefits and potential drawbacks, we propose that a complementary application of the two might work best to capitalize on their advantages over traditional privacy frameworks to regulate police hacking.","","21st century,92811:National Security,Computer industry,Computers,Criminal investigations,Criminal law,Criminal procedure,Electronic surveillance,Germany,Intelligence services,Italy,Jargon,Law,Law enforcement,Legislators,Malware,Netherlands,Peer to peer computing,Portable computers,Privacy,Regulation,Smartphones,Software,United Kingdom--UK,United States--US","",""

Previous research found that perceived effectiveness and enforcement of regulatory policies reduce online privacy concern; however, it does not explain what factors influence this relationship. Based on the survey data, the empirical analysis is conducted on a large sample of internet users in Croatia. Our methodology consists of two parts: first, we use confirmatory factor analysis to validate the latent constructs used in the main model; and then we proceed with model estimation using OLS and ordered probit techniques. This study fills the gap in the existing body of knowledge by analysing different perceptions of the existing legislation and government effort to protect online privacy in the context of sociodemographic characteristics of respondents, computer anxiety, individual desire to maintain control of personal information online, as well as intensity and diversity of online activities. Our results indicate that perceived effectiveness of government regulation reduces online privacy concern whereas computer anxiety has a major positive impact on online privacy concern. These findings might be useful for national policy-makers and for business strategies, especially in the context of the GDPR regulation introduced in 2018.","","Anxiety,Business And Economics,Confirmatory factor analysis,Croatia,Data integrity,Enforcement,Internet,Legislation,Personal control,Personal information,Policy making,Privacy,Regulation,Sociodemographics,data protection,online privacy concern","",""

Alexa, an example of a home automation device, assists users by answering questions, reporting the news, and playing music.29 Most impressively, Alexa can control other appliances in the home via internet connection, such as lightbulbs.30 Further, Samsung's smart refrigerator is also a home automation device.31 Through an application, users can view the inside of the refrigerator on the go to take note of its contents.32 The refrigerator can also create shopping lists and display recipes.33 Next, the Nest Learning Thermostat is a multifaceted device that uses self-programming technology to monitor and change the temperature of the home.34 It also acts as a home security system by sending the consumer digital alerts if it detects smoke, carbon monoxide, or extremely low temperatures that could cause pipes to burst.35 Examples of the final category of home appliance-home networking devices-include WiFi and Cable TV boxes.  "40 EDRs collect vehicle data to identify auto safety issues and ultimately improve road safety.41 While vehicles are not required to have EDRs, if a manufacturer voluntarily includes them, federal regulations regulate what categories of data must be collected.42 Even though EDRs are not mandatory, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated that 96{\%} of new vehicles have them because of the benefit they provide to motor vehicle safety.43 Additionally, manufacturers can use the data collected after vehicle accidents to improve the safety of the cars.  [...]auto-insurance companies have begun using internet-connected telematic devices, also called usage-based insurance ("UBI"), to track how safely consumers drive.44 The insurance companies then use the data collected to set insurance premiums for consumers.45 The devices usually measure a number of data points such as: "miles driven; time of day; where the vehicle is driven (Global Positioning System or GPS); rapid acceleration; hard braking; hard cornering; and air bag deployment.

With the help of 'new social media' applications, like Facebook and Twitter, Internet and mobile phone users can conduct real-time exchanges with millions of people across the globe. Following the Introduction, this Article begins, in Part I, with a discussion of how these tools were used by protesters around the world in 2011. Part II discusses how the same tools were used by governments, both democratic and authoritarian, to respond to the violence and mayhem during that year. In Part III, I turn to a discussion of the relevant policy concerns, first in the American, then the Canadian, legal contexts. It is significant that Canada is the first country to complete an extensive investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. As a result, Facebook users across the world now enjoy stronger privacy protections for their personal information, in terms of how it is collected, used and disclosed. In conclusion, I note that this case has important implications for other online social networking sites, even those based in other countries, which are collecting and using the personal information of Canadians in a way that does not comport with Canadian privacy laws.

Since the late 1990s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been enforcing companies' privacy policies through its authority to police unfair and deceptive trade practices. Despite over fifteen years of FTC enforcement, there is no meaningful body of judicial decisions to show for it. The cases have nearly all resulted in settlement agreements. Nevertheless, companies look to these agreements to guide their privacy practices. Thus, in practice, FTC privacy jurisprudence has become the broadest and most influential regulating force on information privacy in the United States-more so than nearly any privacy statute or any common law tort. In this Article, we contend that the FTC's privacy jurisprudence is functionally equivalent to a body of common law, and we examine it as such. We explore how and why the FTC, and not contract law, came to dominate the enforcement of privacy policies. A common view of the FTC's privacy jurisprudence is that it is thin, merely focusing on enforcing privacy promises. In contrast, a deeper look at the principles that emerge from FTC privacy "common law" demonstrates that the FTC's privacy jurisprudence is quite thick.

Pervasive computing devices will allow applications to gather and share a large amount of information. This may then open up a market for a large range of new services and applications. With a world densely populated by 'smart dust' sensor devices, no single part of our life will be able to escape from digitisation. Soon, sensor networks will be able to track everything from our feelings to our behaviour. Besides the enormous potential value, we can foresee many undesirable uses. In a worst-case scenario, privacy implications, particularly the bad publicity around invasions of privacy, could block the incredible potential of pervasive computing. In this paper, we introduce the privacy issues found in the field of pervasive computing in two parts. The first part provides a brief look at the understanding of privacy, factors that can be used to control privacy, and the development of fair information practices and how they relate to the world of pervasive computing. The second part introduces technology that can provide a tool-set to support these fair information practices, and maintain the role of the data subject in the management of their private information.

First we discuss privacy requirements grounded in both historic and contemporary perspectives on privacy. We use a three-layer model of user privacy concerns to relate them to system operations (data transfer, storage and processing) and examine their effects on user behavior. In the second part of the paper we develop guidelines for building privacy-friendly systems. We distinguish two approaches: "privacy-by-policy" and "privacy-by-architecture." The privacy-by-policy approach focuses on the implementation of the notice and choice principles of fair information practices (FIP), while the privacy-by-architecture approach minimizes the collection of identifiable personal data and emphasizes anonymization and client-side data storage and processing. We discuss both approaches with a view to their technical overlaps and boundaries as well as to economic feasibility. The paper aims to introduce engineers and computer scientists to the privacy research domain and provide concrete guidance on how to design privacy-friendly systems.

The same can be said for questions of privacy. This article starts by showing how and why information assurance and privacy can become problems worthy of ethical consideration. It demonstrates that there is no simple and linear relationship between ethics and information assurance, nor between ethics and privacy. Many decisions in the area of IT, however, affect not only one but both of these subjects. The ethical evaluation of decisions and actions in the area of privacy and security is therefore highly complex. The article explores the question of whether individual responsibility is a useful construct to address ethical issues of this complexity. After introducing a theory of responsibility, the article discusses the conditions that a subject of responsibility is typically assumed to fulfil. The article will argue that individual human beings lack some of the essential preconditions necessary to be ascribed responsibility. Individuals have neither the power, nor the knowledge, nor the intellectual capacities to successfully deal with the ethical challenges in the tension of privacy and information assurance. The article ends by suggesting that the concept of responsibility may nevertheless be useful in this setting, but it would have to be expanded to allow collective entities as subjects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","","5250:Telecommunications systems {\&} Internet communi,9130:Experimental/theoretical,Computer privacy,Computer security,Computers--Electronic Data Processing,Ethics,Information systems,Studies","",""

These types are: (1) sporadic users, (2) socializers, (3) entertainment type users, (4) instrumental users, and (5) advanced users. In the context of the research part of this study, a survey was conducted in a sample of smartphone and tablet owners. The five user types were identified in our sample by setting specific classification rules, based on the frequency and the variety of mobile services used. Mobile users' perceptions were assessed in terms of ten different kinds of security breaches. The findings indicated that the user types perceive differently the economic importance of security breaches, implying that the design of security policies and/or the development of tools totally for the community of users are not the appropriate practices. Our research could contribute to the knowledge considering mobile users and their perceptions about security breaches.

In this work, we are exploring the background of IoT systems and security measures, and identifying (a) different security and privacy issues, (b) approaches used to secure the components of IoT-based environments and systems, (c) existing security solutions, and (d) the best privacy models necessary and suitable for different layers of IoT driven applications. In this work, we proposed a new IoT layered model: generic and stretched with the privacy and security components and layers identification. The proposed cloud/edge supported IoT system is implemented and evaluated. The lower layer represented by the IoT nodes generated from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) as Virtual Machines. The middle layer (edge) implemented as a Raspberry Pi 4 hardware kit with support of the Greengrass Edge Environment in AWS. We used the cloud-enabled IoT environment in AWS to implement the top layer (the cloud). The security protocols and critical management sessions were between each of these layers to ensure the privacy of the users' information. We implemented security certificates to allow data transfer between the layers of the proposed cloud/edge enabled IoT model. Not only is the proposed system model eliminating possible security vulnerabilities, but it also can be used along with the best security techniques to countermeasure the cybersecurity threats facing each one of the layers; cloud, edge, and IoT.","","Automation,Computer security,Data integrity,Data transfer (computers),Electronic commerce,Explosions,Internet crime,Internet of Things,Literature reviews,Privacy,Protocol (computers),Radio frequency identification,Research,Sciences: Comprehensive Works,Security,Security management,Security systems,Sensors,Virtual environments,Web services,Wireless networks,cloud computing,edge computing,privacy,security policy","",""

The study investigates a hierarchical model of individual traits, information privacy orientation and consumer privacy concerns.              Design/methodology/approach              - The empirical research utilizes structural equation modeling to analyze the responses from 964 respondents.              Findings              - The results suggest that consumer attitudes toward data collection programs associated with personal shopping information (e.g. retail loyalty card programs) are determined through a hierarchical model of personal traits and contextual-dependent variables. Specifically, the authors find that the compound traits of risk orientation and need for cognition influence the situational trait of information privacy orientation which leads to the surface trait of consumer privacy concern and ultimately attitude toward the information collection program.              Practical implications              - The results suggest several means to increase participation in data collection programs. Although high need for cognition and high risk orientation cannot be changed, communication plans can provide guarantees that mitigate perceived risk associated with sharing personal information and highlight the information value to the individual's sharing of information.              Originality/value              - While previous research focuses on either the internal traits or external traits, this research contributes to the current literature by offering insights into how privacy evolves from more abstract personality traits to more situational-specific behavioral tendencies, which then influence attitudes and behavior.","","54172:Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities,7000:Marketing,9130:Experimental/theoretical,Attitudes,Behavior,Business And Economics--Marketing And Purchasing,Consumers,Participation,Personal information,Personality traits,Population,Privacy,Research,Studies","",""

This note argues that a strict federal data breach notification law would not only appease businesses tired of having to comply with forty-six different state laws but would also increase incentives for businesses to disclose by reducing the cost of compliance and increasing the reputational risk associated with security breaches.

Any change at the social level affects more or less the internal mechanisms of the organization. Amendments to international law on the processing of personal data also have effects on these information structures. From this perspective, we intend to analyze, in a comprehensive way, the main areas of influence that privacy and privacy laws have upon the library. Thus, we investigated the library-user relationship, library-employee, and some of the ethics of information issues. Obviously, on a national scale, all these ideas will have a specific treatment after the unitary analysis of the intersection of legislation with the field of practical data activity. We consider that approaches related to the convergence of the personal data processing with the ethics of information and the main practical procedures that will be implemented in Romania have not only a theoretical justification but above all, became a prerequisite to act rightful.Alternate abstract:Bibliotecile rom{\^{a}}neşti sunt instituţii puternic ancorate {\^{i}}n mediul social, prin care işi duc la {\^{i}}ndeplinire rolul de pol cultural şi educaţional al comunităţii.

This provision is not innovative, as it formalizes into EU law the distinction between “core” and “periphery” of rights present in many national constitutions and in the ECJ and ECtHR case law. Nonetheless, the express reference to essence has given unprecedented resonance to that concept. Essence as the “limit of limits” has a Janus-like character. On the one hand, it pronounces that every fundamental right bears a minimum content which is ringfenced from interference by public and private actors. On the other hand, it stresses the malleability of rights and their social function. The core/periphery dichotomy reflects a balancing act moored in European legal tradition whose symbolism outperforms its utility as a judicial tool. This Article examines the essence clause of the Charter in light of the ECJ case law and the constitutional traditions of the Member States and assesses its role in the framework of fundamental rights protection in EU law. The Article first attempts a classification of rights limitations clauses in national constitutions, following which it discusses the interpretation of essence by the Spanish and the Italian Constitutional Courts. The Article then engages with a theoretical discussion of the concept of essence and examines the case law of the ECJ. Lastly, it looks at the limitations of the concept as a rights protection instrument in EU law.","","Articles,Case law,Center and periphery,Charter of Rights-Canada,Charters,Classification,Constitutional courts,Constitutional law,Constitutions,EU Charter of Fundamental Rights,Essence of rights,European Court of Justice,Greece,Human rights,International law,Italy,Law,Legislatures,Limitations,Lithuania,Member states,Social function,Spain,Symbolism,Traditions,fundamental rights,national constitutions","",""

As the cybersecurity risk has appeared as a significant threat to the financial sector, researchers and analysts are trying to understand this problem from different perspectives. There are plenty of documents providing conceptual discussions, technical analysis, and survey results, but empirical studies based on real data are yet limited. Besides, the international and national regulatory bodies suggest guidelines to help banks and financial institutions managing cyber risk exposure. In this paper, we synthesize relevant articles and policy documents on cybersecurity risk, focusing on the dimensions detrimental to the banking system's vulnerability. Finally, we propose five new research avenues for consideration that may enhance our knowledge of cybersecurity risk and help practitioners develop a better cyber risk management framework.","","Bank operational risks,Banking stability,Banking system,Business And Economics--Investments,Computer security,Cyber risk,Cybersecurity,Empirical analysis,Financial institutions,Hazards,IT costs,Institutional performance,Regulatory agencies,Risk management,Systematic review,Vulnerability","",""

These digital intermediaries will save us time by purchasing grocery items, transferring bank accounts, and subscribing to cable. The literature has only begun to hint at the paradigm shift needed to navigate the legal risks and rewards of this coming era of automated commerce . This Article begins to fill that gap by surveying legal battles related to contract exit, data access, and deception that will determine the extent to which automated assistants are able to help consumers to search and switch, potentially bringing tremendous societal benefits. Whereas observers have largely focused on protecting consumers and sellers from digital intermediaries' market power, sellers like Amazon, Comcast, and Wells Fargo can also harm consumers by obstructing automated assistants Advancing consumer welfare in the automated era requires not just consumer protection, but digital intermediary protection. The Article also shows the unpredictable side of eliminating switching costs. If digital assistants become pervasive, they could gain the ability to rapidly direct millions of consumers to new purchases whenever a lower price or new innovation becomes available. Significantly accelerated consumer switching-what I call hyperswitching-does not inevitably harm society. But in the extreme it could make some large markets more volatile, raising unemployment costs or financial stability concerns as more firms fail. This new kind of disruption could pose challenges for commercial and banking regulators akin to those familiar to securities regulators, who deploy idiosyncratic tools such as a pause button for the stock market. Even if sellers prevent extreme hyperswitching, managers may strategically prepare for hyperswitching with economically costly behavior such as hoarding liquid assets or forming conglomerates to provide insurance against a sudden exodus of customers. The transaction-cost-focused literature has missed macro-level drawbacks. The regulatory architecture reflects these scholarly gaps. One set of agencies regulates automated assistants for consumer protection and antitrust violations but does not go beyond those microeconomic inquiries. Nor do they prioritize strengthening digital intermediaries Regulators with more macroeconomic missions lack jurisdiction over automated assistants. The intellectual framework and regulatory architecture should expand to encompass both the upsides and downsides of digital consumer sovereignty.","","92615:Regulation, Licensing, and Inspection of Mis,Antitrust,Automation,Bailouts,Competitive advantage,Consumer protection,Consumers,Efficient markets,Law,Regulation of financial institutions,Stock exchanges,Wall Street Reform {\&} Consumer Protection Act 2010-","",""

With the rapid spread of cybercrime, preventive measures geared towards individuals such as anti-criminalization, anti-bullying and anti-phishing propaganda, the practice of shaping negative attitude towards crimes, and discovery of responsibility for committing cybercrimes gain in importance. Society improvement as a countermove to cut out criminal factors provoking a positive or neutral attitude to cybercrimes should be geared towards better living, as the higher is the standard the lower is the level of cybercrime. Taking individualized preventing measures to people prone to commit cybercrimes will prevent against such even before they take place (with cyber extortion and ransomware threats, such actions gain in relevance). For the fight against cybercrime, special programs are to level down victimization in the field of cybersecurity by fostering a shielding attitude in persons who can become victims. The path of designing such programs will lead to a drop cybercrime activity. Specific public authorities and non-governmental organizations should take part in the preventive process.

While external cybercrime is a real threat, security risks abound inside healthcare organizations as well. Even healthcare organizations with strong protection, through firewalls and other technologies, face internal risks. Risk management should consider the risks to patient safety and data security. Both are important. Healthcare organizations might want to supplement their regular risk management activities with these steps recommended by security experts: 1. Conduct a risk audit. 2. Develop a risk remediation process. 3. Make risk remediation an iterative process. 4. Look for "low-hanging fruit." 5. Consider technology solutions. 6.

It is increasingly important that individuals are provided with real choices and are empowered to negotiate for meaningful consent. Meaningful consent is an important area for consideration in IoT systems since privacy is a significant factor impacting on adoption of IoT. Obtaining meaningful consent is becoming increasingly challenging in IoT environments. It is proposed that an "apparency, pragmatic/semantic transparency model" adopted for data management could make consent more meaningful, that is, visible, controllable and understandable. The model has illustrated the why and what issues regarding data management for potential meaningful consent [1]. In this paper, we focus on the `how' issue, i.e. how to implement the model in IoT systems. We discuss apparency by focusing on the interactions and data actions in the IoT system; pragmatic transparency by centring on the privacy risks, threats of data actions; and semantic transparency by focusing on the terms and language used by individuals and the experts. We believe that our discussion would elicit more research on the apparency model' in IoT for meaningful consent.","","Consent,Data management,Engineering,Internet of Things,IoT system,Privacy,Semantics,computer network security,data actions,data management,data privacy,meaningful consent,privacy protection","",""

To the individual, spams are usually little more than a nuisance, but collectively they expose Internet users to a panoply of new risks while threatening the communications and commercial infrastructure. Spamming also raises important questions of criminological interest. On the one hand it is an example of a pure cybercrime - a harmful behaviour mediated by the Internet that is the subject of criminal law, while on the other hand, it is a behaviour that has in practice been most effectively contained technologically by the manipulation of 'code' - but at what cost? Because there is not an agreed meaning as to what constitutes 'online order' that renders it simply and uncritically reducible to a set of formulae and algorithms that can be subsequently imposed (surreptitiously) by technological processes. The imposition of order online, as it is offline, needs to be subject to critical discussion and also checks and balances that have their origins in the authority of law. This article deconstructs and analyses spamming behaviour, before exploring the boundaries between law and code (technology) as governance in order to inform and stimulate the debate over the embedding of cybercrime prevention policy within the code itself.

The model was tested using data from an empirical survey with 913 randomly selected social media users.FindingsPrivacy concerns are jointly determined by perceived privacy risks and privacy self-efficacy. The perceived effectiveness of institutional privacy assurances in terms of established privacy policies and privacy protection technology influences the perceptions of privacy risks and privacy self-efficacy. More specifically, privacy invasion experiences are negatively associated with the perceived effectiveness of institutional privacy assurances.Research limitations/implicationsPrivacy concerns are conceptualized as general concerns that reflect an individual's worry about the possible loss of private information.

Some of these are operational issues and others relate to regulatory and compliance requirements that vary by industry and location. There is a growing body of guidance that seeks to clarify the implications of these concerns for various parts of the cloud supply chain. This paper provides a review of the business and legal risks associated with cloud computing and critically reviews the guidance available. It pays particular attention to the implications of the PRISM revelations for the development of a cloud marketplace that aims to keep data private and secure. A number of responses to cloud risks are available, including technological fixes and business responses. Each response has its own costs and requirements in terms of organisational capability and the paper evaluates the various responses that potential cloud adopters can use to manage the risks associated with cloud computing.

In particular, today's Web ecosystems are presided over by multisided online platforms, extracting and analyzing personal data in the absence of express obligations to protect and promote their users' interests. Not surprisingly, over the past twenty years scholars have begun reaching back to "old school" common law doctrines for guidance. One promising legal field entails fiduciary duty-based relationships, which have a robust, globe-spanning history stretching hundreds of years. The latest such approach is the information fiduciaries (IF) model, introduced by academics Jack Balkin and Jonathan Zittrain. The IF model posits that OSPs should be required to abide by fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and confidentiality with regard to their end users. A recent draft paper by Lina Khan and David Pozen, however, sees an unsolvable incongruity between a mandated duty of loyalty, and both the corporate law of Delaware, and the financial imperatives of online advertising-based companies such as Facebook. As it turns out, while the IF model 's creators invoke the fiduciary duty of loyalty, in reality their model relies on mandated obligations rooted only in care and confidentiality. Fortunately, the IF model does not exhaust the richness and depth of fiduciary law doctrine. Another proposed approach is the "digital trustmediary" (DTM), a cornerstone feature of the GLIAnet project2). The DTM model involves entities providing advanced digital service to their clients, while voluntarily operating under heightened fiduciary duties of loyalty, care, and confidentiality. The opt-in DTM model is positioned as a well-considered alternative to a current Web ecosystem generally lacking in bona fide fiduciary-like relationships. The IF model of mandated care, and the DTM model of voluntary loyalty, present two different but complementary approaches to injecting greater trust and accountability in the Web. Finally, other tenets of the common law remain available for exploration. Indeed, what could be termed "digital common law " holds the potential to contribute usefully to modern day conversations about the role of digital technologies in society.","","Common law,Confidentiality,Corporate law,End users,Fiduciaries,Fiduciary responsibility,Internet service providers,Loyalty,Technology: Comprehensive Works","",""

Technological advancements have created new ways to collect, use and disseminate these data. The ‘processing' of the data frequently crosses borders.2 The important role of personal data and the international dimension of the processing necessitate an adequate protection.3 To strengthen this protection, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted Regulation 2016/679/EU of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data [2016] OJ L119/1 (General Data Protection Regulation, ‘GDPR').4 Pursuant to Article 99, the Regulation will apply from 25 May 2018. It creates several obligations for the ‘controller' and the ‘processor' and rights for the ‘data subject'. This article proceeds as follows. Section ‘The case of the international energy company' sketches a fictional case that shows that the security of personal data depends on many different actors. Sections ‘The international energy company' through ‘The developer of the firewall' give an overview of the obligations of these parties. This overview shows that the duty to secure personal data can be based on a patchwork of different European and national rules. In Section ‘Synthesis', I analyse several factors that influence the harmonization of the duty.

The framework identifies key social values and ethical issues, provides some brief explanatory contextual information which is then followed by a set of questions aimed at the technology developer or policy-maker to facilitate consideration of ethical issues, in consultation with stakeholders, which may arise in their undertaking. In addition, the framework includes a set of ethical tools and procedural practices which can be employed as part of the ethical impact assessment.

However, conceptualizations of information privacy have been somewhat patchy in current privacy literature. In this article, we review the conceptualizations of information privacy through three different lenses (information exchange, social contract and information control), and then try to build upon previous literature from multiple theoretical lenses to create a common understanding of the organization-consumer information interaction in the context of Business-to-Consumer electronic commerce (B2C e-commence). We argue that consumers' privacy beliefs are influenced by the situational and environmental cues that signal the level of privacy protections in a particular environment. The framework developed in this research should be of interest to academic researchers, e-commerce vendors, legislators, industry self-regulators, and designers of privacy enhancing technologies.

In the traditional way of cloud computing there is a possibility for the cloud service providers(CSP) to view, access, modify, and monitor the utilized resources of the cloud customers thus the privacy is a major concern for a cloud customers(CC), especially when sensitive data such as personal profile, financial records, medical reports, etc. are outsourced to the cloud server. In this paper, a model is proposed to support primarily the privacy issues of the customers and providers by incorporating the concept of the trusted third party(TTP) that can manage the computing process held on between CC and CSP without revealing their identities to each other. The trusted third party is an autonomous system that facilitates secure communication between the two parties and it ensures a customer to have highlevel of trust on cloud providers by guarantying the privacy protection of the data.","","Cloud Computing Services,Cloud computing,Communications systems,Computers,Customers,Data Security and Integrity,Privacy,Storage facilities,Third party,Trust,Trusted Third Party,Trusted third parties,User Authentication,privacy","",""

This market is experiencing fast growth; however, an in-depth understanding of Chinese consumers within this is lacking. Perceived risk is a key construct in Western consumer decision making, whereas whether this is true in China's IBS market is rarely researched. An exploration of this dynamic market is therefore critical to develop theoretical and practical implications. To maximise the comparability with existing Western findings, the current research adopts a quantitative approach to measure Chinese consumers' risk perception. However, as the existing literature provides limited guidelines associated with the current context, exploratory research was conducted to establish a general understanding and to identify additional elements of this particular market. A detailed instrument was developed and examined Chinese consumers' risk perception in depth. Primary data were collected by self-administered questionnaires containing 504 respondents from southern China. Exploratory factor analysis is employed to identify critical risk factors. Results indicate that the concept of perceived risk has merit in explaining Chinese consumers' decisions on whether to use IBS. Results clearly reveal that the significant risk barriers identified are influenced by culture and do not simply follow predominant Western patterns. Suggestions for banks are developed in an attempt to overcome these risk barriers. The current research adds value to the existing literature in that findings reinforce the need to (re)examine Western theories from a more critical perspective. This also leads to a discussion addressing further areas for open debate and research.","","5220:Information technology management,52211:Commercial Banking,52212:Savings Institutions,8100:Financial services industry,9130:Experimental/theoretical,9179:Asia {\&} the Pacific,Bank technology,Banking industry,Branch banking,Business And Economics--Marketing And Purchasing,China,Consumer behavior,Consumers,Cost control,Economic models,Electronic banking,Financial services,Market strategy,Marketing,Risk exposure,Studies","",""
