However, with big data comes big responsibility. The collection, storage, sharing, and analysis of data are far outpacing individual privacy protections, whether technological or legislative. The Internet of Things (IoT), with its promise to create networks of networks, will magnify individual data privacy threats. Recent data breaches, exposing the personal information of millions of users, provide insight into the vulnerability of personal data. Although seemingly expansive, there are core individual privacy issues that are central to current big data breaches and anticipated IoT threats. This article examines both big data and the IoT using examples of data privacy breaches to illustrate the impact of individual data loss. Furthermore, the article examines the complexity of tackling technological and legislative challenges in protecting individual privacy. It concludes by summarizing these issues in terms of the future implications of the IoT and the loss of privacy.","","Big Data,Business And Economics,Canada,Complexity,Data integrity,Data loss,Data management,Entrepreneurship,Internet of Things,Privacy,Studies","",""

The study investigates a hierarchical model of individual traits, information privacy orientation and consumer privacy concerns.              Design/methodology/approach              - The empirical research utilizes structural equation modeling to analyze the responses from 964 respondents.              Findings              - The results suggest that consumer attitudes toward data collection programs associated with personal shopping information (e.g. retail loyalty card programs) are determined through a hierarchical model of personal traits and contextual-dependent variables. Specifically, the authors find that the compound traits of risk orientation and need for cognition influence the situational trait of information privacy orientation which leads to the surface trait of consumer privacy concern and ultimately attitude toward the information collection program.              Practical implications              - The results suggest several means to increase participation in data collection programs. Although high need for cognition and high risk orientation cannot be changed, communication plans can provide guarantees that mitigate perceived risk associated with sharing personal information and highlight the information value to the individual's sharing of information.              Originality/value              - While previous research focuses on either the internal traits or external traits, this research contributes to the current literature by offering insights into how privacy evolves from more abstract personality traits to more situational-specific behavioral tendencies, which then influence attitudes and behavior.","","54172:Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities,7000:Marketing,9130:Experimental/theoretical,Attitudes,Behavior,Business And Economics--Marketing And Purchasing,Consumers,Participation,Personal information,Personality traits,Population,Privacy,Research,Studies","",""

The interdisciplinary approach is a unique feature and guarantees important new insights in the social, ethical and legal implications of these technologies for the individual and society as a whole. Its aim is to shed light on the tension between secrecy and transparency in the digital era. A special focus is put from the perspectives of psychology, medical ethics and European law on the contradiction between individuals' motivations for consented processing of personal data and their fears about unknown disclosure, transferal and sharing of personal data via information and communication technologies (named the ""privacy paradox""). Potential benefits and harms for the individual and society resulting from the use of computers, mobile phones, the Internet and social media are being discussed. Furthermore, the authors point out the ethical and legal limitations inherent to the processing of personal data in a democratic society governed by the rule of law. Finally, they seek to demonstrate that the impact of information and communication technology use on the individuals' well-being, the latter being closely correlated with a high level of fundamental rights protection in Europe, is a promising feature of the socalled ""e-democracy"" as a new way to collectively attribute meaning to large-scale online actions, motivations and ideas.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","","Computer privacy,Data integrity,Ethics,Information technology,Philosophy","",""

The aim of the article is to analyse the principles and peculiarities of safe management of the personal data in social networks. In this scientific article, methods of document analysis, scientific literature review, case study and generalization are used. Consumers themselves decide how much and what kind of information to publicize on the Facebook social network. In order to use the third-party applications, users at the time of authorization must confirm that they agree to give access to their personal data otherwise the service will not be provided. Personal data of the Facebook user comprise his/her public profile including user's photo, age, gender, and other public information; a list of friends; e-mail mail; time zone records; birthday; photos; hobbies, etc. Which personal data will be requested from the user depends on the third-party application. Analysis of the legal protection of personal data in the internet social networks reveals that it is limited to the international and European Union legal regulation on protection of the personal data in the online social networks. Users who make publicly available a large amount of personal information on the Facebook social network should decide on the issue if they want to share that information with third parties for the use of their services (applications).

In recent years, alongside these public health tools, commercial mobile apps such as Sickweather have also been released. Sickweather collects information from across the web, as well as self-reports from users, so that people can see who is sick in their neighborhood. The purpose of this paper is to examine the privacy and surveillance implications of digital disease tracking tools.Design/methodology/approachThe author performed a content and platform analysis of two apps, Sickweather and HealthMap, by using them for three months, taking regular screenshots and keeping a detailed user journal. This analysis was guided by the walkthrough method and a cultural-historical activity theory framework, taking note of imagery and other content, but also the app functionalities, including characteristics of membership, “rules” and parameters of community mobilization and engagement, monetization and moderation. This allowed me to study HealthMap and Sickweather as modes of governance that allow for (and depend upon) certain actions and particular activity systems.FindingsDraw on concepts of network power, the surveillance assemblage, and Deleuze's control societies, as well as the data gathered from the content and platform analysis, the author argues that disease tracking apps construct disease threat as omnipresent and urgent, compelling users to submit personal information – including sensitive health data – with little oversight or regulation.Originality/valueDisease tracking mobile apps are growing in popularity yet have received little attention, particularly regarding privacy concerns or the construction of disease risk.","","Analytics,Applications programs,Big Data,Community relations,Computers--Internet,Crowdsourcing,Data,Data mining,Disease tracking,Epidemics,Imagery,Infectious diseases,Mobile apps,Mobile computing,Privacy,Public health,Social networks,Surveillance,Surveillance medicine,Tools,Tracking,User generated content,Web sites","",""

Studies show that individuals are concerned about database privacy; yet, they seldom make privacy a salient attribute when deciding among competing alternatives. Although privacy policies are present on many Web sites, Web users rarely bother to read them. Professor Nehf explores why this is so, identifying rational reasons why Web users do not shop for privacy and discussing the implications for the expanding market for consumer information. Unless privacy becomes a salient attribute influencing consumer choice, Web site operators will continue to obtain and use more personal information than Web users would choose to provide in a more transparent exchange. In a responding commentary, Professors Pitt and Watson use an ecosystem approach that explores the multiple dimensions of privacy. Investigating the interactions between the three major players-citizen/consumer/investor, government, and corporation-they identify reasons for the failure of market mechanisms to arise to protect privacy.

We find that users are primarily motivated to disclose information because of the convenience of maintaining and developing relationships and platform enjoyment. Countervailing these benefits, privacy risks represent a critical barrier to information disclosure. However, users' perception of risk can be mitigated by their trust in the network provider and availability of control options. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for network providers.

We focus on the economic value and consequences of protecting and disclosing personal information, and on consumers' understanding and decisions regarding the trade-offs associated with the privacy and the sharing of personal data. We highlight how the economic analysis of privacy evolved over time, as advancements in information technology raised increasingly nuanced and complex issues. We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance and detract from individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences. We conclude the article by highlighting some of the ongoing issues in the privacy debate of interest to economists.

Thus, its guarantees were included in the high-level regulations of the European Union as well as the legal norms of the EU Member States. The first Polish law regulating the protection of personal data was adopted in 1997 as the implementation of EU Directive 95/46. The law imposed a number of obligations on public and private entities which process personal data in order to protect the rights of data subjects and, in particular, to guarantee them the ability to control the correctness of processing of their personal data. Therefore, the law obliged data controllers to process data only on the basis of the premises indicated in the legislation, to adequately secure data, and to comply with the disclosure obligation concerning data subjects, including their right to correct false or outdated data or to request removal of data processed in violation of the law. However, as complaints directed by citizens to the supervisory body?the Inspector General for Personal Data Protection?showed, personal data controllers, especially those operating in the private sector, did not comply with the law, acting in a manner that violated their customers? rights. In the hitherto existing unfair business practices of entrepreneurs, the violations of the data protection provisions that were the most burdensome for customers were related to preventing them from exercising their rights, including the right to control the processing of data, as well as the failure to provide the controller?s business address, which made it impossible for subjects whose data were used in violation of the law or for the inspecting authorities to contact the company, a lack of data security and a failure to follow the procedures required by law, the failure to secure documents containing personal data or their abandonment, a lack of updating customer data, the use of unverified data sets and sending marketing offers to deceased people or incorrect target recipients, and excessive amounts of data requested by controllers. The violations of the rights of data subjects recorded in Poland and other EU Member States-among other arguments-provided inspiration for the preparation of a new legal act in the form of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (which entered into force on 25 May 2018). The extension of the rights of people whose data are processed was combined in the GDPR with the introduction of new legal instruments disciplining data controllers. Instruments in the form of administrative fines and the strongly emphasised possibility to demand compensation for a violation of the right to data protection were directed in particular against economic entities violating the law.","","Business ethics,Consumer protection,Data integrity,Entrepreneurs,General Data Protection Regulation,Guarantees,Personal information,Poland,Right of privacy,Sociology","",""

Based on the survey data, the empirical analysis is conducted on a large sample of internet users in Croatia. Our methodology consists of two parts: first, we use confirmatory factor analysis to validate the latent constructs used in the main model; and then we proceed with model estimation using OLS and ordered probit techniques. This study fills the gap in the existing body of knowledge by analysing different perceptions of the existing legislation and government effort to protect online privacy in the context of sociodemographic characteristics of respondents, computer anxiety, individual desire to maintain control of personal information online, as well as intensity and diversity of online activities. Our results indicate that perceived effectiveness of government regulation reduces online privacy concern whereas computer anxiety has a major positive impact on online privacy concern. These findings might be useful for national policy-makers and for business strategies, especially in the context of the GDPR regulation introduced in 2018.","","Anxiety,Business And Economics,Confirmatory factor analysis,Croatia,Data integrity,Enforcement,Internet,Legislation,Personal control,Personal information,Policy making,Privacy,Regulation,Sociodemographics,data protection,online privacy concern","",""

Technological advancements have created new ways to collect, use and disseminate these data. The ‘processing' of the data frequently crosses borders.2 The important role of personal data and the international dimension of the processing necessitate an adequate protection.3 To strengthen this protection, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted Regulation 2016/679/EU of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data [2016] OJ L119/1 (General Data Protection Regulation, ‘GDPR').4 Pursuant to Article 99, the Regulation will apply from 25 May 2018. It creates several obligations for the ‘controller' and the ‘processor' and rights for the ‘data subject'. This article proceeds as follows.

However, some analysts argue that these practices have the potential to invade applicants' privacy because they gather personal data that were originally intended for family and friends, or collect information that is not job related (e.g., off duty behavior, membership in protected classes) ( Gross {&} Acquisti, 2005 ;  Tabibi, 2012 ). Despite the growing use of SNS data in the selection process, little theory or research has examined applicants' reactions to these practices. Thus, we used a model of privacy ( Stone {&} Stone, 1990 ) to explain the factors that affect applicants' perceptions of invasion of privacy when SNS data are used in the hiring process. We also made minor additions to the model to fit the SNS context. The privacy model suggests that several information, procedural, sociocultural, and individual factors influence applicants' reactions, and we offer hypotheses based on the model to guide future research. We also consider the implications for establishing fair information policies, and balancing the needs of the organization for information against applicants' rights to privacy.","","Business And Economics--Labor And Industrial Relations,Employers,Human resources,Social networks","",""

Despite international trends towards greater protection of personal information significant challenges to personal privacy arise in this context. These include the use of outsourcing by businesses, the encroachment of security laws and the potential 'spill-over' of technologies developed for combating terrorism into the private sector. Also significant are technologies enabling the 'profiling' of individuals and 'data mining' across borders. Against this backdrop the article considers existing jurisdictional responses towards regulating personal information flows across borders. It considers various actual or proposed solutions including 'safe-harbours', contractual mechanisms and extra-territorial applications. The article concludes that many of the existing approaches to regulating trans-border information flows are to some extent deficient and suggests the need for a new 'fourth generation' set of data protection protocols. In formulating the latter, analogies are drawn from other relevant areas of the law in order to furnish creative solutions to the problem.","","Technology: Comprehensive Works","",""

However, privacy advocates have expressed concern over the potential for wireless carriers, the government, and third parties to collect and store personal information. Congress has addressed these concerns with legislation, but privacy advocates still worry that consumers are not adequately protected. This Note addresses this concern and argues that in order to ensure consumer protection, additions are needed to section 222 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Note discusses the importance of individual privacy and balances it against the benefits of location technology.

The data set of Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) 2014/2015 and 42 semi-structured interviews conducted with victims of cybercrime and non-victim control group participants were analysed via binary logistic regression and content analyses methods.FindingsThis research illustrated that Internet users facilitated their victimisation through their online activities. Additionally, using insecure Internet connections and public access computers emerged as risk factors for both cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent crime victimisation. Voluntary and involuntary personal information disclosure through social networking sites and online advertisement websites increased the likelihood of being a target of phishing. Deviant online activities such as free streaming or peer-to-peer sharing emerged to increase the risk of cyber-dependent crime victimisation.Research limitations/implicationsThe binary logistic regression analysis results suggested LRAT as a more suitable theoretical framework for cyber-dependent crime victimisation.

The Court's interpretation of this notion had a considerable impact not only jon perception of the essence in other fields of law, but also on the constitutional doctrine more generally. This Article focuses on specificities of the notion of essence of fundamental rights to privacy and the protection of personal data from Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. After a general analysis, situating this notion into the framework of multi-level protection of fundamental rights in Europe, the Article addresses further interpretative challenges relating to the essence in the Court's case law. At the core of the analysis are the Schrems and Digital Rights Ireland cases, where the CJEU developed, for the first time, the modalities of the breach of essence of fundamental rights to privacy and data protection and laid down constitutional foundations for interpretation of this notion. Further jurisprudence, including the Tele2 Sverige and Opinion 1/15 cases, is analyzed as an example of fine-tuning of the CJEU's approach towards the normative understanding of this concept. Against this backdrop, the Article elaborates on the importance of insights in the fields of privacy and data protection for the general constitutional understanding of the concept of essence and proposes a generalized method for determination of infringement of essence in fundamental rights jurisprudence.","","Articles,Case law,Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU,Charters,Constitution,Constitutional law,Constitutions,Courts,Data,Data protection,Essence of fundamental rights,First time,Germany,Human rights,Infringement,Jurisprudence,Law,Privacy,Right of privacy,Schrems case,data protection,privacy","",""

The conceptual model includes four variables: security concerns, perceived risk of cyberattacks, perceived government cybersecurity preparedness and e-services avoidance. Data from 774 participants were used to analyze our conceptual model.FindingsFirst, the findings show that security concerns regarding personal information safety and perceived risk of cyberattacks are barriers to e-services use, with the former having a stronger effect. Second, the findings showed that perceived government cybersecurity preparedness significantly reduces security concerns and perceived risk of cyberattacks. Third, the post hoc group analysis between individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher versus those without a bachelor's degree showed that the effect of both security concerns and perceived risk of cyberattacks on e-services avoidance was greater for individuals without a bachelor's degree. The same relationship between perceived risk of cyberattacks and e-services avoidance was not supported for individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher.Originality/valueExtant privacy research fails to adequately examine the role of institutional factors, such as government efforts, and how these mitigate or amplify cybersecurity concerns and risks related to e-services.

Today, billions of electronic devices and sensors collect, store, and analyze personal information from how fast we drive, to how fast our hearts beat, to how much and what we watch on TV. Even children provide billions of bits of personal information to the cloud through ""smart"" toys that capture images, recognize voices, and more. The unprecedented and unbridled new information flow generated from the little things of the IoT is creating big challenges for privacy regulators. Traditional regulators are armed with conventional tools not fully capable of handling the privacy challenges of the IoT. A critical review of recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement decisions sheds light on a recommended path for the future regulation of the IoT. This Article first examines the pervasiveness of the IoT and the data it collects in order to clarify the challenges facing regulators. It also highlights traditional privacy laws, principles, and regulations and explains why those rules do not fit the novel challenges and issues resulting from the IoT. Then it presents an in-depth analysis of four key FTC enforcement decisions to highlight how the FTC has and can regulate the IoT without undermining the innovation and benefits that this technology-and the data it provides- brings to our society. Specifically, the Article describes how the FTC, faced with the privacy challenge that accompanies the interconnected world of the IoT, has managed to apply traditional standards of ""unfairness"" and ""deceptive practices"" to protect private information. The FTC has been flexible and nimble with its interpretations of such standards and, in its most recent IoT case, FTC v. VIZIO, established a new ""tool"" in its toolkit for regulating IoT devices: an ""unfair tracking"" standard. As the de facto data protection authority in the United States, the FTC can use this new tool to work toward standardizing its treatment of IoT privacy issues instead of trying to fit those concerns neatly under the deception authority of section 5 of the FTC Act. However, this new tool also means that the FTC has the opportunity-and responsibility-to provide guidance on how it will wield that authority. To assure that innovation is not stifled and that this new rule is fairly applied (whether by the FTC or other agencies that may follow suit), it is imperative that the FTC diligently address concerns about the scope of this new rule and communicate that guidance to businesses, other regulators, and consumers alike. The new FTC administration should, as the primary regulator of information privacy and the IoT, continue the strong practice established by the previous administration, which is to provide guidance to businesses, consumers, and other regulators navigating the big challenges caused by the little things in the IoT.","","Automation,Computer privacy,Consumer protection,Consumers,Enforcement,Internet access,Internet of Things,Law,Personal information,Wireless access points","",""

Indian consumers' online privacy concerns are found to be positively impacted by their perceived vulnerability to unauthorized gathering and use of personal information, and negatively impacted by their perceived ability to control the manner in which their personal information is collected and used online. The consumers' perceived vulnerability is negatively affected by their level of Internet literacy and their perceived ability to control the collection and use of information. In turn, the perceived ability to control information collection and use is positively influenced by both the Internet literacy level and the social awareness of the consumer. The privacy concerns of Indian consumers are found to negatively impact both their willingness to provide personal information to Websites, and their willingness to engage in e-commerce transactions. The implications of the findings for Websites targeting the Indian authence are discussed.

Rapid development of ubiquitous computing and 'the internet of things' are leading to Big Data and the application of Predictive Analytics, effectively merging the real world with cyberspace. The power of information technology is increasingly used to provide personalised services to citizens, leading to the availability of huge amounts of sensitive data about individuals, with potential and actual privacy-eroding effects. To protect the private sphere, deemed essential in a state of law, information and communication systems (ICTs) should meet the requirements laid down in numerous privacy regulations. Sensitive personal information may be captured by organizations, provided that the person providing the information consents to the information being gathered, and may only be used for the express purpose the information was gathered for. Any other use of information about persons without their consent is prohibited by law; notwithstanding legal exceptions. If regulations are properly translated into written code, they will be part of the outcomes of an ICT, and that ICT will therefore be privacy compliant. We conclude that privacy compliance in the 'technological' sense cannot meet citizens' concerns completely, and should therefore be augmented by a conceptual model to make privacy impact assessments at the level of citizens' lives possible.","","5200:Communications {&} information management,9130:Experiment/theoretical treatment,Big Data,Business And Economics,Data analysis,Information management,Internet access,Privacy,Studies,Value chain","",""

In addition, the paper aims at establishing how they interfere with user privacy and determine the users' level of awareness. Design/Methods/Approach: For the purpose of this paper, existing literature was reviewed and analysed, and a questionnaire was distributed in a digital form. 229 respondents participated in the survey. Findings: It has been found that smart energy meters collect very accurate information about users' electricity consumption at short intervals. The information can then be used to identify devices, identify the presence or absence of people, their habits and activities. According to the survey results, the awareness among people using smart energy meters is low. Research Limitations/Implications: The limitations stem from the survey sample, as only people who are users of online social networks, e-mail and internet messaging applications (Viber, WhatsApp) were included in the survey. Practical Implications: The paper presents key findings in the field of smart energy meters and their potential for compromising individuals' safety and privacy. The paper discusses different ways in which energy consumption information can be exploited and used to harm users, as well as methods for establishing a secure and reliable network. Originality/Value: Due to the increasing share of smart energy meters installed in Slovenia, there is an increasing risk of privacy intrusions and threats to the safety of individuals. The research findings will help increasing users' awareness about smart energy meters and prevent potential abuse of their data.Alternate abstract:Namen prispevka: Namen prispevka je predstaviti klju{v{c}}ne lastnosti pametnih merilnikov energije, njihove prednosti in slabosti ter ugotoviti, kako posegajo v uporabnikovo zasebnost in kak{v{s}}no zavedanje o tem imajo ljudje.

Nowadays, millions of people connect with their friends and families by sharing their personal information with the help of different forms of social media. Sometimes, individuals face different types of issues while maintaining the multimedia contents like, audios, videos, photos because it is difficult to maintain the security and privacy of these multimedia contents uploaded on a daily basis. In fact, sometimes personal or sensitive information could get viral if that leaks out even unintentionally. Any leaked out content can be shared and made a topic of popular talk all over the world within few seconds with the help of the social networking sites. In the setting of Internet of Things (IoT) that would connect millions of devices, such contents could be shared from anywhere anytime. Considering such a setting, in this work, we investigate the key security and privacy concerns faced by individuals who use different social networking sites differently for different reasons. We also discuss the current state-of-the-art defense mechanisms that can bring somewhat long-term solutions to tackling these threats.","","Computer security,Computers--Computer Networks,Digital media,Internet crime,Internet of Things,Multimedia,Privacy,Social networks","",""

If this information is accessed by an unauthorized party, identity theft or other fraud may result. The affected organization may face fines or other penalties, in addition to notification and security upgrade costs related to the breach. Further, companies may incur costs resulting from litigation stemming from the potential liability exposure. For these reasons, an examination of the stock market's assessment of the costs of data breaches is warranted. One of the most significant events in the history of data breaches occurred at ChoicePoint. In February 2005, ChoicePoint, self-described as the ""nation's leading provider of identification and credential verification services"" (ChoicePoint, 2006), disclosed that thieves had created false accounts for the purpose of obtaining personal information with which to commit identity theft and subsequent fraud. Initially, ChoicePoint estimated that the information of 140,000 people had been compromised, and at the time of the announcement, more than 700 documented instances of identity theft had already been directly linked to the data breach (Weber, 2005). Since that time, the incidence of exposures that could lead to identity theft has noticeably increased. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer information and advocacy organization, estimates more than 440 instances of reported exposures to potential identity theft have occurred between the February 2005 ChoicePoint incident and December 2006 due to data breaches at corporations, universities, and government agencies. The organization further estimates that the number of records exposed in these breaches exceeds 100 million (Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, 2007).","","3400:Investment analysis {&} personal finance,4300:Law,5200:Communications {&} information management,8200:Insurance industry,9190:United States,Data integrity,Effects,Employees,Insurance,Insurance industry,Personal information,Shareholders wealth,United States--US","",""

In this article, we report the findings of a project in which we used cultural probes to generate discussion about personal digital dataveillance. Our findings suggest the prevailing dominance of tacit assumptions about the uses and benefits of dataveillance as well as fears and anxieties about its possible misuse. Participants were able to identify a range of ways in which dataveillance is conducted, but were more aware of obvious commercial and some government actors. There was very little identification of the types of dataveillance that are used by national security and policing agencies or of illegal access by hackers and cybercriminals. We found that the participants recognised the value of both personal data and the big aggregated data sets that their own data may be part of, particularly for their own convenience. However, they expressed concern or suspicion about how these data may be used by others, often founded on a lack of knowledge about what happens to their data. The major question for our participants was where the line should be drawn. When does personal dataveillance become too intrusive, scary or creepy? What are its drawbacks and risks? Our findings suggest that experimenting with innovative approaches to elicit practices and understandings of personal digital data offers further possibilities for greater depth and breadth of social research with all types of social groups.","","1653:social control; police, penology, {&} correctional problems,Aggregate level data,Big Data,Bioethics,Civil rights,Data,Dominance,Government agencies,Hacking,Illegal,National security,Policing,Public spaces,Qualitative research,Scandals,Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works,Social groups,Social networks,Social research,Society,Sociology,State laws,Web 2.0","",""

Big data defies this linear logic, in that it decontextualizes data from its original environment and conducts an algorithmic nonlinear mix, match, and mine analysis. Applying data protection law to the processing of big data does not work well, to say the least.This Article examines the case of big medical data. A survey of emerging research practices indicates that studies either ignore data protection law altogether or assume an ex post position, namely that because they are conducted after the data has already been created in the course of providing medical care, and they use de-identified data, they go under the radar of data protection law. These studies focus on the end-point of the lifecycle of big data: if sufficiently anonymous at publication, the previous steps are overlooked, on the claim that they enjoy immunity. I argue that this answer is too crude. To portray data protection law in its best light, we should view it as a process-based attempt to equip data subjects with some power to control personal data about them, in all phases of data processing.Such control reflects the underlying justification of data protection law as an implementation of human dignity. The process-based approach fits current legal practices and is justified by reflecting dignitarian conceptions of informational privacy.","","44511:Supermarkets and Other Grocery (except Conve,Big Data,Indictments,Law,Supermarkets","",""

Our study revealed a shift in policy over time from a rigid to a more collaborative approach to regulation. From the 1980s to the 2000s, security control measures were developed to prevent leakage of personal data to external entities, using methods such as anonymisation, which can be applied in a linkable or unlinkable fashion. However, by the 2010s, de-identification measures have been introduced. They make it possible to utilise personal data that is de-identified (not completely, but specific individuals cannot be easily identified) in certain types of genomic research. This also involved the establishment of an independent data protection authority that controls the utilisation of data in collaboration with other stakeholders. Through this process, bioethics policy has become an established science and technology policy in Japan; and in recent years, bioethics policy has also gained relevance in areas outside the life sciences.","","Bioethics,Bioethics policy,Biology--Biotechnology,Collaboration,Genomes,Human genome research,Japan,Life sciences,Personal data,Science and technology policy","",""

After identifying the benefits from various AI usages and the risks posed by AI-related technologies, I then analyze legal frameworks and relevant discussions in the EU, USA, Canada, and Japan, and further consider the efforts of Privacy by Design (“PbD”) originating in Ontario, Canada. While various AI usages provide great convenience, many issues, including profiling, discriminatory decisions, lack of transparency, and impeding consent, have emerged. The unpredictability arising from the AI machine learning function poses further difficulties, which have only been partially addressed by legal frameworks in the aforementioned jurisdictions. However, analyzing the relevant discussions yielded several suggestions. The first priority is adopting PbD as the most flexible, soft-legal, and preferable approach toward AI-oriented issues. Implementing PbD will protect individual privacy and personal data without specific efforts, and achieve both the development of AI and the advancement of privacy and personal data protection. Technical measures that can adapt to an individual's dynamic choices according to the “context” should be further developed. Furthermore, alternative technical measures, including those to solve the “algorithmic black box” or achieve differential privacy, warrant thorough examination. If AI surpasses human intelligence, a terminating function, such as a “kill switch” will be the last resort to preserve individual choice. Despite numerous difficulties, we must prepare for the coming AI-prevalent society by taking a flexible approach.","","Artificial intelligence,Comparative study,Computers--Artificial Intelligence,Learning algorithms,Machine learning,Personal data,Privacy,Profiling,Robots","",""

Some IoT applications are already on the market, such as in a smart home, wearable, connected vehicle, medical and healthcare, smart grids, and so on. However, the increasing use of IoT, especially in the individual domain, causes the opening of security vulnerabilities. Various studies have attempted to identify security issues on IoT. Many studies indicate that data privacy is one of the primary considerations in IoT because of the high possibility of creating security risks, such as unauthorized access, tapping, data modification, data forgery and so on. Some IoT services and applications provide personal and sensitive information openly and can be misused because of the leakage of data to third parties. Several studies state that the enforcement mechanism of IoT is still inadequate. Besides, there are issues such as identification problems, authentication and authorization, and cross-device dependencies. From the various vulnerabilities, threat sources have been identified by previous researchers apart from bad manufacturers and outside parties, namely IoT users themselves as owners of devices that intentionally or unintentionally provide access to sensitive information. From that case, user awareness becomes a critical aspect of the IoT ecosystem. Some countries are known to have prepared themselves with strategies and master plans in dealing with the IoT era. This study seeks to identify what efforts have been made by the government and other stakeholders in promoting IoT security for end-users in various countries and what best practices can be learned from existing initiatives, and what aspects might still need further research.","","Australia,Authentication,Computer privacy,Computers--Computer Security,End users,Internet of Things,Security management,Singapore,Smart buildings,Smart grid,Studies,United States--US","",""

Despite international trends towards greater protection of personal information, significant challenges to personal privacy arise in this context. These include the use of outsourcing by businesses, the encroachment of security laws and the potential 'spill-over' of technologies developed for combating terrorism into the private sector. Also significant are technologies enabling the 'profiling' of individuals and 'data mining' across borders. Against this backdrop, the article considers existing jurisdictional responses towards regulating personal information flows across borders. It considers various actual or proposed solutions including 'safe-harbours', contractual mechanisms and extra-territorial applications. The article concludes that many of the existing approaches to regulating trans-border information flows are to some extent deficient and suggests the need for a new 'fourth generation' set of data protection protocols. In formulating the latter, analogies are drawn from other relevant areas of the law in order to furnish creative solutions to the problem.","","Technology: Comprehensive Works","",""

As a result, the laissez-faire perspective on regulating the internet and data collection has fallen to the wayside as efforts to protect consumer data through regulation gain international traction. Leading in the charge to protect consumers' personal information is the European Union with its passage of the General Data Protection Regulation, which went into full force May 2018. Following suit, and central to this Comment, is California's recent passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Generally, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request that businesses disclose to the consumer what personal information is being collected or sold by the business. Subject to some limitations, consumers may also request the business refrain from selling their personal data or delete their personal information. The Act further establishes requirements for companies with respect to their management of private user data, and it provides civil penalties and a private right of action for certain violations and breaches. This Comment examines whether it is the job of individual state legislatures or Congress to enact legislation for the purpose of protecting consumer data. This Comment analyzes how the First Amendment, preemption, and the Dormant Commerce Clause come into conflict with the CCPA. The benefits and the drawbacks of empowering states to act as laboratories for democracy are also examined. This Comment articulates the view that one robust and comprehensive federal law should be enacted and have preemptive effect. The federal government can provide important data protection and privacy thresholds, and states should have the flexibility to provide additional enforcement mechanisms to meet their local needs.","","California,Consent,Consumer protection,Consumers,Data collection,Data integrity,Education,Europe,General Data Protection Regulation,Internet,Legislation,Personal information,Privacy,Scandals,Social networks,Software,United States--US","",""

Our study results show that users are concerned that their sensed data can be misused, used for personal identification and tracking or for commercial purposes. However, they are willing to trade privacy for additional benefits if their sensed information is used for effective and beneficial causes. Furthermore, they are willing to trust reputed technology companies, with their data, if the benefits are significant.

It is estimated that identity theft resulted in the loss of {$}221 billion worldwide in 2003, with {$}73.8 billion lost in the US alone.

These digital intermediaries will save us time by purchasing grocery items, transferring bank accounts, and subscribing to cable. The literature has only begun to hint at the paradigm shift needed to navigate the legal risks and rewards of this coming era of automated commerce . This Article begins to fill that gap by surveying legal battles related to contract exit, data access, and deception that will determine the extent to which automated assistants are able to help consumers to search and switch, potentially bringing tremendous societal benefits. Whereas observers have largely focused on protecting consumers and sellers from digital intermediaries' market power, sellers like Amazon, Comcast, and Wells Fargo can also harm consumers by obstructing automated assistants Advancing consumer welfare in the automated era requires not just consumer protection, but digital intermediary protection. The Article also shows the unpredictable side of eliminating switching costs. If digital assistants become pervasive, they could gain the ability to rapidly direct millions of consumers to new purchases whenever a lower price or new innovation becomes available. Significantly accelerated consumer switching-what I call hyperswitching-does not inevitably harm society. But in the extreme it could make some large markets more volatile, raising unemployment costs or financial stability concerns as more firms fail. This new kind of disruption could pose challenges for commercial and banking regulators akin to those familiar to securities regulators, who deploy idiosyncratic tools such as a pause button for the stock market. Even if sellers prevent extreme hyperswitching, managers may strategically prepare for hyperswitching with economically costly behavior such as hoarding liquid assets or forming conglomerates to provide insurance against a sudden exodus of customers. The transaction-cost-focused literature has missed macro-level drawbacks. The regulatory architecture reflects these scholarly gaps. One set of agencies regulates automated assistants for consumer protection and antitrust violations but does not go beyond those microeconomic inquiries. Nor do they prioritize strengthening digital intermediaries Regulators with more macroeconomic missions lack jurisdiction over automated assistants. The intellectual framework and regulatory architecture should expand to encompass both the upsides and downsides of digital consumer sovereignty.","","92615:Regulation, Licensing, and Inspection of Mis,Antitrust,Automation,Bailouts,Competitive advantage,Consumer protection,Consumers,Efficient markets,Law,Regulation of financial institutions,Stock exchanges,Wall Street Reform {&} Consumer Protection Act 2010-","",""

However, no set of principles has yet achieved universal adoption. This note proposes a principle mandating that personal data be securely destroyed when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. Including a data deletion principle in future data protection standards will increase respect for individual autonomy and decrease the risk of abuse of personal data. Though data deletion is already practiced by many data controllers, including it in legal data protection mandates will further the goal of establishing an effective global data protection regime.

This research examines the privacy policies of large U.S. companies to assess the substance and quality of their stated information practices. Six factors are identified that indicate the extent to which a firm is dependent upon consumer personal information, and therefore more likely to develop high quality privacy statements. The study's findings provide practical and theoretical implications for information privacy issues, particularly for consumers who need to determine whether or not to disclose their personal identifying information to firms. The results illustrate the complexity involved in managing personal private information.

By algorithms we mean predictive models (decision rules) captured from historical data using data mining. Such models often decide prices we pay, select ads we see and news we read online, match job descriptions and candidate CVs, decide who gets a loan, who goes through an extra airport security check, or who gets released on parole. Yet growing evidence suggests that decision making by algorithms may discriminate people, even if the computing process is fair and well-intentioned. This happens due to biased or non-representative learning data in combination with inadvertent modeling procedures. From the regulatory perspective there are two tendencies in relation to this issue: (1) to ensure that data-driven decision making is not discriminatory, and (2) to restrict overall collecting and storing of private data to a necessary minimum. This paper shows that from the computing perspective these two goals are contradictory. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically with standard regression models that in order to make sure that decision models are non-discriminatory, for instance, with respect to race, the sensitive racial information needs to be used in the model building process. Of course, after the model is ready, race should not be required as an input variable for decision making. From the regulatory perspective this has an important implication: collecting sensitive personal data is necessary in order to guarantee fairness of algorithms, and law making needs to find sensible ways to allow using such data in the modeling process.","","14.13:COMPUTERS,2600:Management science/operations research,4320:Legislation,5200:Communications {&} information management,9130:Experimental/theoretical,Airport security,Airports,Algorithms,Analysis,Computation,Computer information security,Computers--Artificial Intelligence,Data mining,Decision making,Fairness,Finland,Legislation,Modelling,Netherlands,Non-discrimination,Personal data,Personal information,Race,Regression,Regression models,Sensitive data,Studies","",""

Despite the importance of understanding the nature of online consumers' concerns for information privacy, this topic has received little attention in the information systems community. To fill the gap in the literature, this article focuses on three distinct, yet closely related, issues. First, drawing on social contract theory, we offer a theoretical framework on the dimensionality of Internet users' information privacy concerns (IUIPC). Second, we attempt to operationalize the multidimensional notion of IUIPC using a second-order construct, and we develop a scale for it. Third, we propose and test a causal model on the relationship between IUIPC and behavioral intention toward releasing personal information at the request of a marketer. We conducted two separate field surveys and collected data from 742 household respondents in one-on-one, face-to-face interviews. The results of this study indicate that the second-order IUIPC factor, which consists of three first-order dimensions - namely, collection, control, and awareness - exhibited desirable psychometric properties in the context of online privacy.

However, individuals increasingly fear how such practices may negatively affect them. Although previous studies have investigated individuals' concerns about information privacy practices, the adverse consequences people associate with external actors accessing their personal information remain unclear. To mitigate customers' fears, organisations need to know which adverse consequences individuals are afraid of and how to address those negative perceptions. To investigate this topic, we conducted 22 focus groups with 119 participants. We developed a comprehensive conceptualisation and categorisation of individuals' perceived adverse consequences of access to their information that includes seven types of consequences: psychological, social, career-related, physical, resource-related, prosecution-related, and freedom-related. Although individuals may limit their interactions with an organisation owing to consequences they associate with both the organisation and other actors, organisations can apply preventive and corrective mechanisms to mitigate some of these negative perceptions. However, organisations' scope of influence is limited and some fears may be mitigated only by individuals themselves or government regulation, if at all.","","Computers--Computer Networks,Customer services,Data analysis,Perceptions,Personal information,access to individuals' information,focus group study,information privacy,mitigation mechanisms,perceived adverse consequences","",""

The conventional wisdom in both countries, whether accurate or not, is that the modern political campaign needs to be ‘data driven' to consolidate existing support and to find potential new voters and donors. The capture and consolidation of these data permit the construction of detailed profiles on individual voters and the ‘micro-targeting' of increasingly precise messages to increasingly refined segments of the electorate, especially in marginal constituencies.1 Although there are huge differences between presidential systems such as the US and European parliamentary systems, there is evidence that parties in other countries are drawing lessons from the US experience and that similar techniques are gradually entering their politics.2 There is extensive cross-national communication about these techniques through the network of political and technical consultants, who are eager to tout the benefits of micro-targeting and data-driven campaigning, and to sell the range of software applications, for both database and mobile environments.","","81394:Political Organizations,Big Data,Canada,Databases,Democracy,Elections,Europe,Law,Marketing,Political parties,Privacy,State laws,Surveillance,Trends,United States--US","",""

Currently, there also are several pending federal pieces of legislation that could impact insurers and others that maintain databases containing personal information susceptible to breaches. In 2000, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners formed a Privacy Issues Working Group to study the problem to focus on consumer privacy protection efforts in the insurance industry. This article outlines the privacy breach implications for insurers. Specifically, we focus on examples of recent breaches in the insurance industry and the cost of breaches to firms and individuals.

In order to generate recommendations, the service needs to access various types of user data such as previous product purchasing history, demographic and biographical information. However, users are sensitive to disclosure of personal information as it can be easily misused by malicious third parties. Consequently, there are unavoidable security concerns which will become known through attempted unauthorized access while providing the recommendation services. In order to protect against breaches of personal information, it is necessary to obfuscate the user information by means of an efficient encryption technique while simultaneously generating the recommendation by making true information inaccessible to the system. To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving recommender system using homomorphic encryption, by which the system can provide recommendations without knowing the actual ratings. Our approach is based on the ElGamal cryptosystem by which both addition and multiplication of plaintexts can be performed. The performance of the proposed scheme shows significantly high accuracy in-terms of computation and communication costs as well as outperforming other existing solutions.","","Computers--Computer Engineering,Data privacy,Encryption,Homomorphic encryption,Multiplication,Personal information,Privacy,Recommender systems","",""

In particular, today's Web ecosystems are presided over by multisided online platforms, extracting and analyzing personal data in the absence of express obligations to protect and promote their users' interests. Not surprisingly, over the past twenty years scholars have begun reaching back to ""old school"" common law doctrines for guidance. One promising legal field entails fiduciary duty-based relationships, which have a robust, globe-spanning history stretching hundreds of years. The latest such approach is the information fiduciaries (IF) model, introduced by academics Jack Balkin and Jonathan Zittrain. The IF model posits that OSPs should be required to abide by fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and confidentiality with regard to their end users. A recent draft paper by Lina Khan and David Pozen, however, sees an unsolvable incongruity between a mandated duty of loyalty, and both the corporate law of Delaware, and the financial imperatives of online advertising-based companies such as Facebook. As it turns out, while the IF model 's creators invoke the fiduciary duty of loyalty, in reality their model relies on mandated obligations rooted only in care and confidentiality. Fortunately, the IF model does not exhaust the richness and depth of fiduciary law doctrine. Another proposed approach is the ""digital trustmediary"" (DTM), a cornerstone feature of the GLIAnet project2). The DTM model involves entities providing advanced digital service to their clients, while voluntarily operating under heightened fiduciary duties of loyalty, care, and confidentiality. The opt-in DTM model is positioned as a well-considered alternative to a current Web ecosystem generally lacking in bona fide fiduciary-like relationships. The IF model of mandated care, and the DTM model of voluntary loyalty, present two different but complementary approaches to injecting greater trust and accountability in the Web. Finally, other tenets of the common law remain available for exploration. Indeed, what could be termed ""digital common law "" holds the potential to contribute usefully to modern day conversations about the role of digital technologies in society.","","Common law,Confidentiality,Corporate law,End users,Fiduciaries,Fiduciary responsibility,Internet service providers,Loyalty,Technology: Comprehensive Works","",""

The latest examples of such regulation are state and federal laws that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving their personal information. These laws, proposed in the wake of highly publicized data spills, seek to punish the breached entity and to protect consumers by requiring the entity to notify its customers about the security breach. There are competing approaches, however, to how the law is to mandate release of information about data leaks. This Article finds that the current statutes' focus on reputational sanction is incomplete. An important function of breach notification is mitigation of harm after a data leak. This function requires a multiinstitutional coordinated response of the kind that is absent from current policy proposals. This Article advocates creation of a coordinated response architecture and develops the elements of such an approach. Central to this architecture is a coordinated response agent (CRA) that oversees steps for automatic consumer protection and heightens mitigation. This Article also proposes a bifurcated notice scheme that lets firms know that the CRA is watching and is scrutinizing their decision whether or not to disclose information about a breach to the affected individuals. Moreover, the CRA will set in motion automatic protective measures on behalf of the breached consumers. Finally, the CRA will regulate the content of notification messages to reflect the nature of the data breach.

With data breaches now a common occurrence, it is becoming increasingly plain that while modern organizations need to put into place measures to try to prevent breaches, they must also put into place processes to deal with a breach once it occurs. Prior research on information technology security and services failures suggests that customer compensation can potentially restore customer sentiment after such data breaches. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, the authors draw on the literature on personality traits and social influence to better understand the antecedents of perceived compensation and the effectiveness of compensation strategies. The authors studied the propositions using data collected in the context of Target's large-scale data breach that occurred in December 2013 and affected the personal data of more than 70 million customers. In total, the authors collected data from 212 breached customers.FindingsThe results show that customers' personality traits and their social environment significantly influences their perceptions of compensation.

The aim of the research was to develop a reliable measurement scale for quantifying and comparing attitudes towards personal data that can be incorporated into cybersecurity behavioural research models. Such a scale has become necessary for understanding individuals' attitudes towards specific sets of data, as more technologies are being designed to harvest, collate, share and analyse personal data.Design/methodology/approachAn initial set of 34 five-point Likert-style items were developed with eight subscales and administered to participants online. The data collected were subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and MANOVA. The results are consistent with the multidimensionality of attitude theories and suggest that the adopted methodology for the study is appropriate for future research with a more representative sample.FindingsFactor analysis of 247 responses identified six constructs of individuals' attitude towards personal data: protective behaviour, privacy concerns, cost-benefit, awareness, responsibility and security. This paper illustrates how the PDA scale can be a useful guide for information security research and design by briefly discussing the factor structure of the PDA and related results.Originality/valueThis study addresses a genuine gap in research by taking the first step towards establishing empirical evidence for dimensions underlying personal data attitudes. It also adds a significant benchmark to a growing body of literature on understanding and modelling computer users' security behaviours.","","26:Security and Protection (CI),Attitudes,Business And Economics--Management,Computer security,Design,Designers,Empirical analysis,Factor analysis,Human behavior,Information systems,Internet of Things,Privacy,Qualitative research,Science,Social networks,Social research","",""

Consumers often have only the stated Web site policies as a guide to how their information is used, and thus on which to base their browsing and transaction decisions. However, each policy is different, and it is difficult--if not impossible--for the average user to compare and comprehend these policies. This paper presents a taxonomy of privacy requirements for Web sites. Using goal-mining, the extraction of pre-requirements goals from post-requirements text artefacts, we analysed an initial set of Internet privacy policies to develop the taxonomy. This taxonomy was then validated during a second goal extraction exercise, involving privacy policies from a range of health care related Web sites. This validation effort enabled further refinement to the taxonomy, culminating in two classes of privacy requirements: protection goals and vulnerabilities. Protection goals express the desired protection of consumer privacy rights, whereas vulnerabilities describe requirements that potentially threaten consumer privacy. The identified taxonomy categories are useful for analysing implicit internal conflicts within privacy policies, the corresponding Web sites, and their manner of operation. These categories can be used by Web site designers to reduce Web site privacy vulnerabilities and ensure that their stated and actual policies are consistent with each other. The same categories can be used by customers to evaluate and understand policies and their limitations. Additionally, the policies have potential use by third-party evaluators of site policies and conflicts.","","Computers--Software","",""

In this article, we explore consumer information privacy issues and review the results of related prior research. We provide a survey of the literature on information privacy based on our assessment from: (1) the societal and public policy perspective, (2) the business practices perspective, and (3) the individual privacy and consumer behavior perspectives that relate to the disclosure of private information by individuals to firms. From the societal and public policy perspective, we identify a number of research directions that relate to the social welfare implications of personal information surveillance, the safeguards needed at the societal level, and the nature of privacy-enhancing regulations. From the business practices perspective, we suggest other research directions that involve the examination of factors influencing organizational choices of privacy practices. We also offer some ways to discover how organizations can leverage their investments in information privacy. The individual and consumer behavior perspective, in turn, prompts Accounting Information Systems (AIS) researchers to look at the nature of people's beliefs and attitudes about privacy; the ways such attitudes affect their intentions and behaviors; and how individuals' behaviors can be influenced by organizational privacy policies and practices. The main contribution of this article is to understand these issues and identify opportunities for AIS researchers to enrich the current body of knowledge on this critical topic.
